* On group creation, if member list is empty report that, not that the group was created.
* In the show groups page, note that we only show groups with members
* In lib/sql/group_info.php3 only unset variables if we need to. In lib/sql/defaults.php3 don't run for groups
  only for users
* Fix Bug #167
Ver 1.72:
* Move the xlat function to a separate file in lib/xlat.php3
* Add a lib/sql/nas_list.php3 to also get the nas list from sql (naslist.conf still works)
* add realms nasdb and nasadmin in username.mappings. nasadmin is used to signify if the
  user is allowed to use the nas_admin page. nasdb is used to shorten the nas list to only
  a few specific entries. That way administrator responsible for a few access servers will
  only be able to administer those access servers and not see the rest of the nas list.
* Add username searching in the find page as suggested by joram agten
* Don't use nas_list in nas_admin
* Add postgresql specific sql schema by apellido jr., wilfredo p. Move each sql schema to a

* Add debug statements in sql connect functions
* Add a missing.php3 file with functions that may be missing from the PHP version used. Include it
  if a function is missing. Currently only array_change_key_case() is included

* Set the general_username_mappings_file variable
* Fix a small error in lib/sql/find.php3. This closes bug #103
* Add a small note in the FAQ about checking for sql/ldap driver availability in PHP if the user get's
  a blank white page back.

Ver 1.70.3:
* Test for unset variable, rather than empty variable in clean_radacct,
  monthly_tot_stats and truncate_radacct.

Ver 1.70.2:

  user DN's (variables supported) instead of performing and ldap search for
  each user. That can be somewhat faster.
* Add a check_user_passwd() and a get_user_dn() functions in lib/ldap/functions.php3
* Add general_restrict_badusers_access directive. If set to yes we only allow each administrator
  access to their own entries in the badusers table

  on the accounting and user settings tables.
* Add an sql_accounting_extra_query directive. If set this query is included in all
  queries to the accounting tables.
  Combined with admin username mappings we are able to easily restrict access on specific accounting data
  to each administrator.
* Escape bad characters in the $login variable
* Add a da_sql_escape_string function. We use that for every element we pass to sql queries in order to
  protect ourselves from sql injection.
* Use the ldap_userdn directive where applicable in the functions.php3 file
* Add an sql_xlat function
* Add a nas administration page for sql based clients
* Fix small bugs in accounting.php3 and user_stats.php3. Add nas_admin.php3 to the buttons page
* Add da_sql_escape_string for all relevant variables in lib/sql files
* Keep the nas list in a separate array $nas_list. Update various pages to use that one now.
* Make nas_list actually work
* Also allow for '-' to exist in a nas name in bin/log_badlogins

* In log_badlogins add a newline after every sql query so that the resulting file can be editable
* Add a force directive in log_badlogins. If uncommented it will force inserts even if there are
  sql errors. That can help in case there is one sql query which stops the whole failed logins
  logging system from working
* Sort the servers list in failed_logins,user_stats,stats
Ver 1.65:
* Add a captions.conf file with a few configurable captions for now

  fit per installation needs
* Add a conf/accounting.attrs allowing the customization of the attributes in the user_accounting,
  user_finger and failed_logins pages

  support lucent equipment apart from cisco
* Update the HOWTO file with a few comments on the general_nas_type directive
* Use the User-Password attribute instead of Password in user_test.php3
Ver 1.63:
* Do an eval on the attribute description strings in the user_edit page. That will allow the login-time creation
  page to work properly.

* When checking the weekly limit check first that $remaining is numeric before doing any comparisons
* Add a usage_summary parameter in user_finger. If it is passed then we only output a text like:
  "Online: <num> Free: <num>" which can be used in outside pages
* Use $config[sql_usergroup_table] in show_groups.php3
* Add a config directive general_stats_use_totacct. If set we use the totacct table in the stats page instead of
  radacct
* Small change in user_accounting.php3
* Escape " in login_time create page before parsing the login-time string
* Add Service-Type in user_edit.attrs

* Only delete sessions which are not open in truncate_radacct. Bug noted by Evren Yurtesen <yurtesen@ispro.net.tr>
* Add a user input tag in user_stats.php3
* Change AcctStopTime = '0' with AcctStopTime IS NULL
* Add a few more attribute help pages from Ulrich Walcher <uwalcher@bcore.de>
* Also check for $server != '' in stats.php3. Bug noted by Ulrich Walcher <uwalcher@bcore.de>
* Consider the account locked either if Dialup-Access == FALSE or if it is not set at all
* Calculate weekly used time correctly (from Sunday 00:00:00)
* Allow for defining the ldap_filter used when searching for a user. The filter supports dynamic variables
  like %u (username) and %U (username provided though http auth)
* Add a configuration directive counter_monthly_calculate_usage to calculate the monthly usage time. Calculate
  it in user_admin if monthly_limit != 'none' or if this directive is set.
  Based on a report by "apellido jr., wilfredo p"
* Add more comments in the admin.conf file
* Show correct calculation of the montlhy usage time.
* Don't show an account as locked if Dialup-Access does not exist and the mapping corresponds to 'none' attribute
* Make clean_radacct and truncate_radacct work correctly

* Update the help page for the lock message attribute
* Update the badusers page to also use the general_accounting_info_order directive
Ver 1.62:
* Remove one sql query from user_admin which was not needed.
* Instead of a query like "LIKE 'YYYY-MM-DD%'" use "AcctStopTime >= 'YYYY-MM-DD 00:00:00 AND AcctStopTime
  <= 'YYYY-MM-DD 23:59:59'" which will allow us to use sql indexes better.
* Add a few comments in bin/clean_radacct
* Add a new script bin/truncate_radacct which will delete all sessions from the radacct table which
  are older than a configurable number of days
* Fix a typo in sql.attrmap. Fix by Evren Yurtesen <eyurtese@turkuamk.fi>
* Work even when register_globals if off. Suggestion from Evren Yurtesen <eyurtese@turkuamk.fi>
  Also add an entry in the FAQ about that.
* We don't need ORDER BY GroupName in show_groups.php3 since we have GROUP BY
* Use CISCO-POP-MGMT-MIB in snmpfinger instead of CISCO-CALL-HISTORY-MIB. Thanks to
  Evren Yurtesen <eyurtese@turkuamk.fi> for the suggestion.
* Remember a few things in the user_test page. Also add another configuration file directive
  general_radius_server_auth_proto specifying the default authentication protocol of the radius
  server (pap or chap).
* Replace single quotes with double quotes in log_badlogins
* Add a missing <?php tag. Bug noted by Simon Burns <simon@ababa.org>
* Add sql_use_http_credentials configuration directive to connect to the sql database using the http user
  credentials (that way there can be more than one administrator usernames, each with different privileges
  on the sql database).
* Add more error messages when interacting with the SQL database
* Add sql_connect_timeout and sql_extra_servers configuration directives to be used by the log_badlogins script
* In log_badlogins create a separate sql input file for each sql server and append sql commands to it. If the
  sql command succeeds we delete the corresponding input file. That way if an sql server is down we store the
  accounting info in the input file and then send it all when it comes back up.
* Add a directive sql_debug. Add debugging statements in the sql library
* Add a directive ldap_debug. Add debugging statements in the ldap library
* Add debug statements in the pg driver
* In debug, output the sql queries in italic. Refer to enabling debugging in the FAQ
* Don't include user_info.php3 in the user_test page.
* Make things a little bit more simple in lib/ldap/change_attrs.php3
* Fix a small bug in lib/ldap/create_user.php3. Unset the mod array before adding any values to it.
* Fix a small problem with debugging
* Do a write lock in radacct before truncating it in truncate_radacct
* In user_new show a select box with all the available groups. Based on an idea by Karel Stadler (kstadler)
* Add a column Admin in the badusers table which will contain the administrator username if that is available
* Add two new tables totacct and mtotacct containing per user aggregated statistics for each day and month
  respectively. Also add two corresponding scripts in the bin folder, tot_stats and monthly_tot_stats. Lastly,
  create a new page, user_stats.php3 which will show the top users in connections or connections duration based
  on the data in the totacct table.
* Add a few comments in the tot_stats and monthly_tot_stats scripts
* Add support for ! in usernames in log_badlogins
* Call gethostbyaddr with an @ in front to suppress error messages
* Also add support for @ in usernames in log_badlogins
Ver 1.61:
* Add a string encoder for greek
* If general_decode_normal_attributes is set then encode attributes in lib/ldap/change_info. In the near future
  language specific user attributes will be added in the change info and new user pages. Remove comments from
  admin.conf about the change info page not working if this directive is used.
* When spliting cn in lib/ldap/create_user.php3 limit the split to 2 new elements not 3.
* Fix a few bugs in log_badlogins
* Fix a parse error in failed_logins.php3
* Fix a bug in lib/defaults.php3 which did not allow the default.vals file to be used correctly
* Include password.php3 in lib/ldap/password_check.php3
* When searching a user in ldap through the find page only try to find the users which have a uid attribute (username)
* Allow selecting a specific access server in the failed logins page
* In the user admin page use AcctStartTime not AcctStopTime when calculating usage for the last 7 days
* Also show server:port in the user test page (so that it shows when used for server checks)
* Now the create user page should work with sql
* Make the default general_lib_type sql instead of ldap
Ver 1.60:
* Use require_once when including lib/functions.php3 in lib/sql
* In the buttons toolbar Edit User should not be clickable.
* Add an arrow gif in htdocs/images to be used in the buttons page when adding multiple finger pages

* Add a few more comments in the admin.conf
* Update the FAQ with an entry about the Online Users page not showing anything.
* Update the FAQ with an entry about sessions.
* Allow the user to add extra attributes in the test user page
* Add a few comments in log_badlogins, support auth logs containing the password, work nice when the client
  is localhost, add an option to scan the whole radius.log and add failed logins in the sql database (can be
  used for initialization).
* html fixes in accounting.php3
* Fix a problem in user_accounting when NASIPAddress is not set.
* Use CISCO-AAA-SESSION-MIB in snmpfinger
* In lib/ldap/functions.php3 only ask for the cn attribute in ldap_search not the whole entry. That should make
  user_finger a lot faster when the user database is in ldap
* In lib/functions.php3 pass a second argument to date2timediv with the current time. user_finger calls that
  function for each online user so we now don't need to do a lot of calls to time() but only one. That should make
  user_finger somewhat faster.
* Fix a small issue with the general_accounting_info_order
* Fix a problem in failed_logins when NASIPAddress is not set.
* Allow for multiple regular profile attributes in a user entry.
* Allow for normal ldap user attributes to be utf8 encoded instead of ascii. Changing attribute values through
  user_info will not work in that case.
* Fix a small bug in lib/ldap/defaults.php3. We should not be using $i in a for() loop but a new variable
* Add a comment in admin.conf about ldap server failover
* Map a specific username to the directory manager if we are using ldap and http authentication
Ver 1.59:
* Small html fixes in user_edit.php3 and password.php3
* Show number of failed logins in the last 7 days in the user admin page
* Show date in the user/server test page
* In config.php3 include a relative admin.conf file not an absolute
* Add an entry in the FAQ about php magic quotes
* Escape double quotes in attribute values in the user edit page
* Fix a bug in lib/sql/change_passwd.php3 when not using operators.
  Bug report from Sheldon Fougere <sfougere@solutioninc.com>
* Add the caller id in the connection status attributes in the show user page
* Allow for multiple default values. Also add a generic flag in ldap attrmap. If it exists then the
  attribute is generic and user values *do not* overwrite default values. The operators in the generic
  attribute can be used for that. The same is very difficult to implement for sql, so for now user
  values overwrite default values in sql (user edit page).
  A lot of code and a lot of files where changed so there may be bugs somewhere.
* In the user edit page print a message under the User Password field about if it exists or not. Update
  the user_info.php3 lib files to check for it.
* In lib/ldap/defaults.php3 Dialup-Access should not be added in the default_vals. It is not inherited.
* If we are editing a group show a comment that in the radiusd sql module the group tables are evaluated
  after the user tables. As a result user values should in general overwrite default values.
* Add support for the default_user_profile of the sql module in lib/sql/defaults.php3
* In sql.attrmap User-Password should map to User-Password, not Password
* If an sql attribute is not contained in sql, assume that it has the same name as in dialup_admin and that
  it is a reply item. Add a comment for that in conf/sql.attrmap.
* Change the way radius attributes are read from the sql database. The change should make things somewhat
  faster. Create a reverse mapping from radius attributes to dialup_admin attributes.
* Add a configuration directive called ldap_use_http_credentials. If it is set to yes then we try to
  connect to the ldap server with the username/password given in http authentication, not those contained
  in admin.conf. That way multiple admins with different permissions on the ldap tree can work on a single
  dialup_admin.
* With the same logic we allow for multiple buttons html pages. We now create a folder html/buttons which
  by default contains a folder default. If the user logs in with http authentication then we try
  to open the file html/buttons/<username>/buttons.html.php3. If we can't we open
  html/buttons/default/buttons.html.php3. That way we can create muiltiple views of say the online users
  page based on which admin requests the page.
* Call config.php3 before outputing any html.
* Add sessions in order to cache the various mappings. Add a corresponding configuration directive
  general_use_session. Also add a session cache destroy page.
* Also cache the admin.conf if use_session is set to 1 in config.php3
* Fix a few bugs
* Remove the auto password generator from the user edit page. It has no meaning since the password is not
  shown
* In lib/sql/defaults.php3 instead of doing a select for each group the user belongs to, do one select with
  a where in () caluse.
* Also cache the default.vals file.
* Update documentation
* Only connect and bind to the ldap server if we haven't done that before.
* Remove previous change. It was causing problems
* In the user test page ignore comments from the auth.request file
* Add a new config directive, ldap_write_server. If it is set then when we update the directory we try to
  connect to that one instead of the ldap_server. That way we can read from the fast read-only replicas and
  write to a slower master.
* Fix a few more bugs
* Add a failed logins page, to show the most recent failed logins.
* Fix a bug in the failed logins page
* Change use of AcctStartTime with AcctStopTime in failed_logins.php3 to match that in user_admin
* Fix a bug with failed logins in user_admin.
* Add the failed logins page in the buttons page
* Add a missing WHERE UserName = '$login' in the UPDATE statement in lib/sql/change_info.php3. Patch by
  Eddie Bindt <eddieb@users.sourceforge.net>
Ver 1.55:
* Update the FAQ about missing attributes from the user/group edit pages and add a few comments
  in the configuration files
* Add support for the Expiration attribute. Add it in the sql attribute map, in user_edit.attrs and
  check for it in user_admin
* Add a few more keys in the userinfo and badusers tables.
* Fix a problem with lib/sql/defaults.php3 where the first character in the default value when using
  operators was set to the opeator
* Add a user find page. User can be searched based on the full name, department or RADIUS attribute.
  The radius attribute should be included in the _user_ profile, not in a group/regular/default profile.
* Add support for the user ldap regular profile attribute in user_edit.attrs
* Fix a stupid bug in accounting.php3. We should not use the show_attrs array.
Ver 1.54:
* Add attributes for the sql group tables in admin.conf. Now SQL group support should really work!
Ver 1.53:
* html fixes in show_groups.php3
* When reporting sql errors also print the output of da_sql_error
* When updating ldap user information don't do an update if the new attribute value
  is '-' (default value)
* Comment out Reply-Message in conf/user_edit.attrs since in sql it maps to the same attribute as
  the lock message
Ver 1.52:
* Add Reply-Message in conf/user_edit.attrs so that it appears in the user/group edit pages
* Allow the administrator to specify a group in the New User page. Update lib/sql/create_user.php3 to add
  the user to the specified group
* Call user_info.php3 and defaults.php3 in user_new.php3 after creating a user
* Only run if $login is not NULL in lib/sql/defaults.php3
* In group admin add a button to administer the selected user which will redirect the administrator to the
  corresponding user_admin page
* Add a show_groups.php3 to show all active user groups
Ver 1.51:
* Only call user_info.php3 in user_new.php3 when we are creating a user
* Fix a bug with personal information attributes in user_new.php3
Ver 1.50:
* Add support for groups in SQL. Added several new files and modified a few more.
* Default values in SQL are now extracted from the group membership. Added a lib/sql/defaults.php3 file.
  As a result the default operator is not '=' anymore but whatever we find in the group check and reply tables.
* In lib/sql/user_info.php3 set user_exists in more than one places.
* Add support for the '=*' and '!*' operators
* Added a HELP_WANTED file describing what are the major things missing which people could contribute.
* Updated TODO

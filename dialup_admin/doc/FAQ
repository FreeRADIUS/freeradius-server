No, there isn't. It's easier for me to write code than to document it :-)
Anyway, I always try to make better documentation.
There's also this FAQ :-)

Make sure that you have configured php to handle files with .php extension

It depends.
If you are using ldap for user authentication/information then you only need
to create the freeradius sql tables (in order to create the radacct table,
the other tables will just sit around doing nothing) which can be created from a
sql script in the freeradius distribution. If you are runing mysql it is in
src/modules/rlm_sql/drivers/rlm_sql_mysql/db_mysql.sql

If you are using mysql for user authentication/information then you will again
need to create the freeradius sql tables and if you want you could also create
the userinfo table to store user information (name,telephone etc)

You could also create the badusers table if you want the functionality it provides.

sql scripts to create the badusers and userinfo tables can be found in the
directory sql (of dialup_admin distribution).

First of all check conf/user_edit.atts and see if the attribute you are interested in is
commented out. If it is just enable it by uncommenting it. If the attribute is not
included in the file add it. If you use SQL check conf/sql.attrmap. If you use LDAP check
${freeradius_install_dir}/etc/raddb/ldap.attrmap and check if the attribute is included in
the attribute mapping. If it is not then add it there also.
Everything should work ok after that.

Check conf/admin.conf and especially the comments about general_finger_type. Make sure that bin/snmpfinger
uses the correct snmpwalk command and that it returns the correct results (snmfinger works on cisco access
servers). Try commenting out general_finger_type so that the Online Users page will just query the radacct
table and not try to do a finger on the NAS.

Dialup-Access is an attribute used by the ldap module. It is not implemented in
the sql module, that's why the mapping is set to none.
You could set Auth-Type to Reject instead.

You may have not enabled support for the corresponding sql driver in PHP. If you are also using ldap, check for
php ldap support.

Check that the register_globals in php.ini is set to on. As of PHP 4.2.0 this is set to off by default. The latest
versions of dialup_admin will work even if register_globals is set to off if the php version is > 4.1.0
(Thanks to Evren Yurtesen <eyurtese@turkuamk.fi> for the suggestion).

In latest versions you can also enable sql debug (sql_debug: true) and ldap debug (ldap_debug: true)

#  This script find duplicates of #include files, ignoring #ifdef's, etc.
#  from C source files, and (at your command) removes the duplicates.
#
#  It is meant to be run ONLY by FreeRADIUS developers, and has nothing
#  whatsoever to do with RADIUS, FreeRADIUS, or configuring a RADIUS server.
#
######################################################################
#
#  Run as: ./min-includes.pl $(find . -name "*.c" -print)
#		prints out duplicate includes from files.
#
#	   ./min-includes.pl -e $(find . -name "*.c" -print)
#		removes the duplicate includes from each file.
#		Remember to check that it still builds!
#
#  It has to be run from the TOP of the FreeRADIUS build tree,
#  i.e. where the top-level "configure" script is located.

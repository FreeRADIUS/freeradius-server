#
#  Sample script to add Attribute/Value pairs in the reply sent to
#  the NAS.
#
#  Before version 2.0 of FreeRADIUS, the script could be run from the
#  deprecated attributes 'Exec-Program' and 'Exec-Program-Wait'.
#  However, these attributes are no longer supported and you have to
#  use the module 'rlm_exec' instead.
#
#  An entry for the module 'rlm_exec' must be added to the file
#  'radiusd.conf' with the path of the script.
#
#modules {
#	exec {
#		program = "/path/to/program/exec-program-wait"
#		wait = yes
#		input_pairs = request
#		output_pairs = reply
#	}
#	...
#}
#
#authorize {
#	...
#	exec
#	...
#}
#
#  Each of the attributes in the request will be available in an
#  environment variable.  The name of the variable depends on the
#  name of the attribute.  All letters are converted to upper case,
#  and all hyphens '-' to underlines.
#
#  For example, the User-Name attribute will be in the $USER_NAME
#  environment variable.  If you want to see the list of all of
#  the variables, try adding a line 'printenv > /tmp/exec-program-wait'
#  to the script.  Then look in the file for a complete list of
#  variables.
#
#  The return value of the program run determines the result
#  of the exec instance call as follows:
#  (See doc/configurable_failover for details)
#  < 0 : fail      the module failed
#  = 0 : ok        the module succeeded
#  = 1 : reject    the module rejected the user
#  = 2 : fail      the module failed
#  = 3 : ok        the module succeeded
#  = 4 : handled   the module has done everything to handle the request
#  = 5 : invalid   the user's configuration entry was invalid
#  = 6 : userlock  the user was locked out
#  = 7 : notfound  the user was not found
#  = 8 : noop      the module did nothing
#  = 9 : updated   the module updated information in the request
#  > 9 : fail      the module failed
#

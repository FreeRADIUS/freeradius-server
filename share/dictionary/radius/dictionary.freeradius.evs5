#  The next two attributes are for sending EAPoL keys to a RADIUS server.

ATTRIBUTE	802_1X-Anonce				1	octets[32]
ATTRIBUTE	802_1X-EAPoL-Key-Msg			2	octets

#
#  @todo - add support for "octets length=uint16" to the dictionaries and to RADIUS.
#
#  In general it's not allowed.  The RADIUS encoder/decoder doesn't support it,
#  though dhcpv4/dhcpv6 does.
#
#  We should really just have dict_validate allow more things, and then move more
#  of the sanity checks to the various protocol callbacks.

# Those values indicated as "standard" are applicable only on a SonicWall
# firewall running standard firmware and not on one running enhanced firmware.

#
# This attribute is to use in place of User-Privilege with RADIUS
# servers that allow only one instance of a Vendor-Specific attribute to be
# set (such as the ACE Server from RSA). Note that it is commented out in this
# file because it is not needed in any servers that support multiple VSA's.
#
# The value of this attribute is a text string giving a comma-separated list
# of one or more privileges, each corresponding to a value of the
# User-Privilege attribute above (and note that some are applicable
# only on a SonicWall firewall running standard firmware as indicated above):
#   "BF,VC,VA,LM,LA,WG,WA,IA"
#   "RA" for "Remote-Access" is now deprecated.
# ATTRIBUTE	User-Privileges   	2	string	SonicWall

# Multiple of these can be set for a user, each specifying the name of a
# user group to which that user has membership. Note that this can
# alternatively be achieved by use of the Filter-Id attribute.
# This is applicable only on a SonicWall firewall running enhanced firmware.

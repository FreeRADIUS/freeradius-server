#
#	DO NOT EDIT THE FILES IN THIS DIRECTORY
#
#	The files in this directory are maintained and updated by
#	the FreeRADIUS project.  Newer releases of software may update
#	or change these files.
#
#	Use the main dictionary file (usually /etc/raddb/dictionary)
#	for local system attributes and $INCLUDEs.
#
#
#
#	This file contains dictionary translations for parsing
#	requests and generating responses.  All transactions are
#	composed of Attribute/Value Pairs.  The value of each attribute
#	is specified as one of a few data types.  Valid data types are:
#
#	string     - printable text, generally UTF-8 encoded.  (The RFCs call this "text")
#	ipaddr     - 4 octets in network byte order
#	ipv4prefix - 1 octet reserved, one octet prefix, 4 octets ipaddr
#	integer    - 32 bit value in big endian order
#	integer64  - 64 bit value in big endian order
#	date       - 32 bit value in big endian order - seconds since
#		     00:00:00 GMT,  Jan.  1,  1970
#	ifid       - 8 octets in network byte order
#	ipv6addr   - 16 octets in network byte order
#	ipv6prefix - 1 octet reserved, one octet prefix, 16 octets ipv6addr
#	tlv	   - type-length-value
#
#	FreeRADIUS includes data types which are not defined
#	in the RFC's.  These data types are:
#
#	abinary - Ascend's binary filter format.
#	byte    - 8 bit unsigned integer
#	ether   - 6 octets of hh:hh:hh:hh:hh:hh
#		  where 'h' is hex digits, upper or lowercase.
#	short   - 16-bit unsigned integer in network byte order
#	signed  - 32-bit signed integer in network byte order
#	octets  - raw octets, printed and input as hex strings.
#		  e.g.: 0x123456789abcdef  The RFCs call this "string".
#
# 	FreeRADIUS uses a number of data types which are defined in
#	RFC 6929.  These data types should NEVER be used in any other
#	dictionary.  We won't even list them here.
#
#
#	Enumerated values are stored in the user file with dictionary
#	VALUE translations for easy administration.
#
#	Example:
#
#	ATTRIBUTE	  VALUE
#	---------------   -----
#	Framed-Protocol = PPP
#	7		= 1	(integer encoding)
#

#
#	Include compatibility dictionary for older users file. Move
#	this directive to the end of this file if you want to see the
#	old names in the logfiles, instead of the new names.
#
$INCLUDE dictionary.compat

#
#	These dictionaries define attributes in the IETF managed space.
#	(i.e. 1..255). This is wrong.  We include them here to allow them.
#	The IETF allocated ones are listed below, which gives them priority.
#
#	i.e. don't do this.  Don't use these attributes
#
$INCLUDE dictionary.usr.illegal
$INCLUDE dictionary.ascend.illegal

#
#	IETF allocated attributes and values.  Split out into
#	the RFC which defined them.

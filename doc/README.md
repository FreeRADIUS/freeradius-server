## Installation

Please see the `INSTALL.md` file, in the parent directory.

Pre-build packages for common Linux systems are available at
http://packages.networkradius.com/

## Configuration Files

Every configuration file contains documentation that explains in
detail what it does, and what each configuration item does.

Reading the configuration files is *required* to fully understand how
to create complex configurations of the server.

## Getting Help

There are two mailing lists for users and developers. General
user, administrator and configuration issues should be discussed
on the users list at:

http://lists.freeradius.org/mailman/listinfo/freeradius-users

When asking for help on the users list, be sure the include a
detailed and clear description of the problem, together with
full debug output from FreeRADIUS, obtained by running

    # radiusd -X

## Where to get it

The latest version of FreeRADIUS is always available from
the git repository hosted on GitHub at

https://github.com/FreeRADIUS/freeradius-server

## Debugging

If you have ANY problems, concerns, or surprises when running
the server, then run it in debugging mode, as root, from the
command line:

    # radiusd -X

It will produce a large number of messages.  The answers to many
questions, and the solution to many problems, can usually be found in
these messages.

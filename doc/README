1. INTRO

  The FreeRADIUS Server Project is a high performance and highly
  configurable multi-protocol policy server, supporting RADIUS, DHCPv4
  and VMPS. It is available under the terms of the GNU GPLv2.

  All code in this server was written for this project.


2. INSTALLATION

   See the INSTALL file, in the parent directory.


3. CONFIGURATION FILES

  Much of the server documentation is included only in the comments in the
  configuration files. Reading the configuration files is REQUIRED to fully
  understand how to create complex configurations of the server.

3a. 'clients.conf'

  Make sure the clients (NAS, switches, access points etc) are set up to
  use the host radiusd is running on as authentication and accounting host.
  Configure these clients with a "radius secret", which should also be
  entered into the client definition in /etc/raddb/clients.conf.
  See also the manual page for clients.conf(5).

3b. 'users'

  Users may be defined in the "users" file (raddb/mods-config/files/authorize).
  All entries are processed in the order as they appear in the file.
  If an entry matches the username, radiusd will stop scanning the users
  file (unless the attribute "Fall-Through = Yes" is set).

  You can uses spaces in usernames by escaping them with \ or by using
  quotes. For example, "joe user" or joe\ user.

  The 'users' file is read by the "rlm_files" module.

3c. NEW RADIUS ATTRIBUTES (to be used in the USERS file).

  Name			Type		Descr.
  ----			----		------
  Simultaneous-Use	integer		Max. number of concurrent logins
  Fall-Through		integer		Yes/No
  Login-Time		string		Defines when user may login.
  Current-Time		string		Allows you to perform time-based
					checks when a request is received.

  Login-Time defines the time span a user may login to the system. The
  format of a so-called time string is like the format used by UUCP.
  A time string may be a list of simple time strings separated by "|" or ",".

  Each simple time string must begin with a day definition. That can be just
  one day, multiple days, or a range of days separated by a hyphen. A
  day is Mo, Tu, We, Th, Fr, Sa or Su, or Wk for Mo-Fr. "Any" or "Al"
  means all days.

  After that a range of hours follows in hhmm-hhmm format.

  For example, "Wk2305-0855,Sa,Su2305-1655".

  radiusd calculates the number of seconds left in the time span, and
  sets the Session-Timeout to that number of seconds. So if someones
  Login-Time is "Al0800-1800" and she logs in at 17:30, Session-Timeout
  is set to 1800 seconds so that she is kicked off at 18:00.


4. LOG FILES

4a. /var/log/radius/radutmp

  In this file the currently logged in users are held. The program "radwho"
  reads this file and gives you a summary. Rogue sessions can be deleted
  from this file with the "radzap" program.

4b. /var/log/radius/radwtmp

  This file is "wtmp" compatible and keeps a history of all radius logins/
  logouts. This file can be read with the "last" program, and other Unix
  accounting programs (such as "ac" and "sac") can be used to produce a
  summary.

4c. /var/log/radius/radius.log

  All RADIUS informational, diagnostic and error messages are logged in
  this file, including all login attempts.

4d. /var/log/radius/radacct/<client_ip>/detail

  This is the original radius logfile, as written by all the Livingston
  radius servers. It's only created if the directory
  /var/log/radius/radacct exists.

  For more configuration options on the detail file please see
  raddb/mods-available/detail as it expands upon this greatly.


5.  MORE INFO, SUPPORT

  The latest version of FreeRADIUS is always available from
  the git repository hosted on GitHub at

    https://github.com/FreeRADIUS/freeradius-server

  or see

    http://freeradius.org/git/

  for more information.

  There are two mailing lists for users and developers. General
  user, administrator and configuration issues should be discussed
  on the users list at:

    http://lists.freeradius.org/mailman/listinfo/freeradius-users

  When asking for help on the users list, be sure the include a
  detailed and clear description of the problem, together with
  full debug output from FreeRADIUS, obtained by running

    radiusd -X

  Developers only discussion is to be had on the devel list:

    http://lists.freeradius.org/mailman/listinfo/freeradius-devel

  Please do not raise general configuration issues here.


6.  OTHER INFORMATION

  The files in other directories are:

  debian/	Files to build Debian Linux packages.

  doc/		Various snippets of documentation
  doc/rfc/	Copies of the RFC's.  If you have Perl, do a 'make' in
		that directory, and look at the HTML output.

  man/		Unix Manual pages for the server, configuration files,
		and associated utilities.

  mibs/		SNMP Mibs for the server.

  raddb/	Default configuration files for the server.

  src/include	header files
  src/modules	dynamic plug-in modules
  src/tests	test harness used by "make test"

  suse/		Files to build SuSE RPM packages.


  If you have ANY problems, concerns, or surprises when running
  the server, then run it in debugging mode, as root, from the
  command line:

  # radiusd -X

  It will produce a large number of messages.  The answers to many
  questions, and the solution to many problems, can usually be found in
  these messages.

  and the 'bugs' file, in this directory.

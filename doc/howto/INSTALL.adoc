== Installation

We recommend installing FreeRADIUS via the pre-built packages available
from http://packages.networkradius.com[Network RADIUS]. Many Operating
System distributions ship versions of FreeRADIUS which are years out of
date. That page contains recent FreeRADIUS packages for all common OS
distributions. For historical purposes, packages of older releases are
also available from that site.

The rest of this document describes how to install FreeRADIUS from
source. i.e. a ``tar.gz'' file.

=== Building from Source

The <<../source/dependencies.adoc#,build dependencies>> must be
installed before FreeRADIUS can build. These dependencies are libtalloc
and libkqueue, which FreeRADIUS uses for memory management, and
platform-independent event handling.

Download the latest version of the FreeRADIUS source from the FreeRADIUS
ftp site:

....
ftp://ftp.freeradius.org/pub/freeadius/
....

The file wil be name something like: `freeradius-server-4.0.0.tar.gz`.
Later version will be `4.0.1`, or `4.1.0`, etc.

Un-tar the file, and change to the FreeRADIUS directory, where
`VERSION` is the version of the server that you have downloaded.

[source,bash]
----
tar -zxf freeradius-server-VERSION.tar.gz
cd freeradius-server-VERSION
----

Take the following steps to build and install the server from source:

[source,bash]
----
./configure
make
make install
----

=== Custom build

FreeRADIUS has GNU autoconf support. This means you have to run
`./configure`, and then run `make`. To see which configuration
options are supported, run `./configure --help`, and read it’s output.

The `make install` stage will install the binaries, the `man' pages,
and MAY install the configuration files. If you have not installed a
RADIUS server before, then the configuration files for FreeRADIUS will
be installed. If you already have a RADIUS server installed, then

*FreeRADIUS WILL NOT over-write your current configuration.*

The `make install` process will warn you about the files it could not
install.

If you see a warning message about files that could not be installed,
then you MUST ensure that the new server is using the new configuration
files, and not the old configuration files as this may cause undesired
behavior and failure to authenticate.

The initial output from running in debugging mode (`radiusd -X`) will
tell you which configuration files are being used. See
link:#upgrading[Upgrading] for information about upgrading from older
versions. There MAY be changes in the dictionary files which are
REQUIRED for a new version of the software. These files will NOT be
installed over your current configuration, so you MUST verify and
install any problem files by hand, for example using `diff(1)` to
check for changes.

When installing fro, source, it is EXTREMELY helpful to read the output
of `./configure`, `make`, and `make install`. If a particular
module you expected to be installed was not installed, then the output
of the `./configure; make; make install` sequence will tell you why
that module was not installed. Please do NOT post questions to the
FreeRADIUS users list without first carefully reading the output of this
process as it often contains the information needed to resolve a
problem.

=== Upgrading To A New Minor Release

The installation process will not over-write your existing configuration
files. It will, however, warn you about the files it did not install.
These will require manual integration with the existing files.

It is generally not possible to re-use configurations between different
major versions of the server. (For example - version 2 to version 3, or
version 3 to version 4.

For details on what has changed between the version, see the
<<../upgrade/#,upgade>> guide.

We STRONGLY recommend that new major versions be installed in a
different location than any existing installations. Any local policies
can then be migrated gradually to the configuration format of the new
major version. The number of differences in the new configuration mean
that is is both simpler and safer to migrate your configurations rather
than to try and just get the old configuration to work.

=== Running the server

If the server builds and installs, but doesn’t run correctly, then you
should first use debugging mode (`radiusd -X`) to figure out the
problem.

This is your BEST HOPE for understanding the problem. Read ALL of the
messages which are printed to the screen, the answer to your problem
will often be in a warning or error message.

We really cannot emphasize that last sentence enough. Configuring a
RADIUS server for complex local authentication isn’t a trivial task.
Your BEST and ONLY method for debugging it is to read the debug
messages, where the server will tell you exactly what it’s doing, and
why. You should then compare its behaviour to what you intended, and
edit the configuration files as appropriate.

If you don’t use debugging mode, and ask questions on the mailing list,
then the responses will all tell you to use debugging mode. The server
prints out a lot of information in this mode, including suggestions for
fixes to common problems. Look especially for ``WARNING'' in the output,
and read the related messages.

Since the main developers of FreeRADIUS use debugging mode to track down
their configuration problems with the server, it’s a good idea for you
to use it, too. If you don’t, there is little hope for you to solve ANY
configuration problem related to the server.

To start the server in debugging mode, do:

[source,bash]
----
radiusd -X
----

You should see a lot of text printed on the screen as it starts up. If
you don’t, or if you see error messages, please read the FAQ:

https://wiki.freeradius.org/guide/FAQ

If the server says ``Ready to process requests.'', then it is running
properly. From another shell (or another window), type

[source,bash]
----
radtest test test localhost 0 testing123
----

You should see the server print out more messages as it receives the
request, and responds to it. The `radtest' program should receive the
response within a few seconds. It doesn’t matter if the authentication
request is accepted or rejected, what matters is that the server
received the request, and responded to it.

You can now edit the configuration files for your local system. You will
usually want to start with `sites-enabled/default` for main
configurations. To set which NASes (clients) can communicate with this
server, edit `raddb/clients.conf`. Please read the configuration files
carefully, as many configuration options are only documented in comments
in the file.

Note that is is HIGHLY recommended that you use some sort of version
control system to manage your configuration, such as git or Subversion.
You should then make small changes to the configuration, checking in and
testing as you go. When a config change causes the server to stop
working, you will be able to easily step back and find out what update
broke the configuration.

It is also considered a best practice to maintain a staging or
development environment. This allows you to test and integrate your
changes without impacting your active production environment. You should
make the appropirate investment in order to properly support a critical
resource such as your authentication servers.

Configuring and running the server MAY be complicated. Many modules have
`man` pages. See `man rlm_pap`, or `man rlm_*` for information.
Please read the documentation in the doc/ directory. The comments in the
configuration files also contain a lot of documentation.

If you have any additional issues, the FAQ is also a good place to
start.

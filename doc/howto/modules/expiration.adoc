= Expiration

Module to expire user accounts.

This module can be used to expire user accounts. Expired users receive
an `Access-Reject` on every authentication attempt. Expiration is based on
the Expiration attribute which should be present in the check item list
for the user we wish to perform expiration checks.

== Topics

Expiration attribute format:

You can use `Expiration := 23 Sep 2004` and the user will no longer be
able to connect at 00:00 (midnight) on September 23rd, 2004. If you want
a certain time (other than midnight) you can do use `Expiration := 23
Sep 2004 12:00`. The nas will receive a `Session-Timeout` attribute
calculated to kick the user off when the Expiration time occurs.

Example entry (users files):

`user1   Expiration := "23 Sep 2004"`

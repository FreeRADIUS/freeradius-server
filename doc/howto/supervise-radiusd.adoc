= Supervising the Radiusd Daemon

== Introduction

We all hope that our radius daemons won’t die in the middle of the nite
stranding customer and beeping beepers. But, alas, it’s going to happen,
and when you least expect it. That’s why you want a another process
watching your radius daemon, restarting it if and when it dies.

This text describes how to setup both the free radius daemon so that it
is automatically restarted if the process quits unexpectedly. To do
this, we’ll use either Dan Bernstein’s `daemontools` package or the
inittab file.

NOTE: The radwatch script that used to be part of this distribution, is
depreciated and _SHOULD NOT BE USED_.

== Setting Up Daemontools

First, download (and install) daemontools from:

```
http://cr.yp.to/daemontools.html
```

The latest version as of this writing is 0.70. It would be well worth
your while to read all the documentation at that site too, as you can do
much more with daemontools than I describe here.

Next, we’ll need a directory for the radius `service` to use with
daemontools. I usually create a dir `/var/svc` to hold all my daemontool
supervised services. i.e.::

```
$ mkdir /var/svc
$ mkdir /var/svc/radiusd
```

Now we just need a short shell script called `run` in our new service
directory that will start our daemon. The following should get you
started:

```
#!/bin/sh
# Save as /var/svc/radiusd/run
exec /usr/local/sbin/radiusd -s -f
```

Of course you’ll want to make that `run` file executable::

`$ chmod +x /var/svc/radiusd/run`

NOTE: you _MUST_ use the `-f` option when supervising. That option tells
radiusd not to detach from the tty when starting. If you don’t use that
option, the daemontools will always think that radiusd has just died and
will (try to) restart it. Not good.

Now the only left to do is to start the `supervise` command that came
with daemontools. Do that like so::

`$ supervise /var/svc/radiusd`

== Maintenance With Daemontools

Any maintenance you need to do with almost certainly be done with the
`svc' program in the deamontools package. i.e.:

Shutdown radiusd: `$ svc -d /var/svc/radiusd`

Start it back up: `$ svc -u /var/svc/radiusd`

Send HUP to radiusd: `$ svc -h /var/svc/radiusd`

Shutdown and stop supervising radiusd: `$ svc -dx /var/svc/radiusd`

== Supervising With Inittab

This is really pretty easy, but it is system dependent. I strongly
suggest you read the man pages for your `init` before playing with this.
You can seriously hose your system if you screw up your inittab.

Add this line (or something similar to it) to your inittab::

`fr:23:respawn:/usr/local/sbin/radiusd -f -s &> /dev/null`

Now all that’s left is to have the system reread the inittab. Usually
that’s done with one of the following::

`$ telinit Q`

or

`$ init q`

Now you should see a `radiusd` process when you issue a `ps`. If you
don’t, try to run the radiusd command you put in inittab manually. If it
works, that means you didn’t tell the system to reread inittab properly.
If it doesn’t work, that means your radius start command is bad and you
need to fix it.

== Further Daemontools notes

Here are some notes by Antonia Dias sent to the free radius mailing
list. Some of you may find this useful after reading the above and the
docs for daemontools.

== Daemontools Instructions

I am running radiusd under supervise from daemontools without problems.
The only thing I am missing right now is an option to force radiusd to
send log to stderr so I can manage logs better with multilog (also
included in daemontools package). Here is the procedure I’ve been
following (for Cistron RADIUS):

```
$ groupadd log
$ useradd -g log log
$ mkdir /etc/radiusd
$ mkdir /etc/radiusd/log
$ mkdir /etc/radiusd/log/main
$ chmod +t+s /etc/radiusd /etc/radiusd/log
$ chown log.log /etc/radiusd/log/main
```

Here are the contents of run files from `/etc/radiusd` and `/etc/radiusd/log`::

```
$ cd /etc/radiusd
$ cat run
#!/bin/sh
exec 2>&1
exec /usr/sbin/radiusd -fyzx
$ cd /etc/radiusd/log
$ cat run
#!/bin/sh
exec setuidgid log multilog t ./main
```

To make service wake-up do::

```
$ ln -sf /etc/radiusd /service
```

Hang-up (to reload config) it using::

```
$ svc -h /service/radiusd
```

Disable (down) it using::

```
$ svc -d /service/radiusd
```

Reenable (up) it using::

```
$ svc -u /service/radiusd
```

= BAY Software

== Description

All versions of the BAY software prior to _18.0.2_ are broken in regards
to the `Message-Authenticator`. They send a strictly MD5 encoded secret
instead of the encoding required by the RFC. This has been fixed in
_18.0.2_ and only _18.0.2_.

If you see messages in the radius log like:

```
Received packet from xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx with invalid Message-Authenticator!
```

and you are using a Bay Annex, then you MUST upgrade the software on
your Annex. There is NO other solution to the problem.

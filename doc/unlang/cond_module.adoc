= The module-code Operator

.Syntax
[source,unlang]
----
module-code
----

The Unlang interpreter tracks the return code of any module that has
been called. This return code can be checked in any condition. If the
saved return code matches the `code` given here, then the condition evaluates
to `true`. Otherwise, it evaluates to `false`.

Module return codes cannot be set in a condition.  Module return codes
cannot be compared with anything else.

The list of valid return codes is as follows:

.Module Return Codes

|ok |the module succeeded

|fail |the module failed
|reject |the module rejected the request
|userlock |the user was locked out
|invalid |the configuration was invalid
|handled |the module has handled the request itself

= String Expansion

String expansion is a feature that allows strings to dynamically
define their value at run time. For historical reasons, these string
expansions are called "xlats".

String expansion is performed via the following syntax:

`%{...}`

Where the `%{` signals the start of a dynamic expansion, and `}`
signals the end of the dynamic expansion.  The contents of the
expansion can be many things:

.String Expansions
[options="header"]
|=====
| Keyword                                           | Description
| link:xlat_attribute.adoc[attributes]              | Expand the value of a named attribute.
| link:xlat_character.adoc[single character]        | Single character expansions.
| link:xlat_module.adoc[modules]                    | Pass a string to a module such as `sql`.
| link:xlat_condition.adoc[condition]               | Conditionally expand a string.
| link:xlat_predefined.adoc[pre-defined expansions] | Such as string length, lowercase strings, etc.
|=====

This feature is used to create policies which refer to concepts rather
than to specific values. For example, a policy can be created that
refers to the User-Name in a request, via:

`%{User-Name}`

This string expansion is done only for double-quoted strings and for
the back-tick operator.

== Caveats

Unlike other languages, there is no way to define new variables.  All
of the string expansions must refer to attributes that already exist,
or to modules that will return a string value.

== Character Escaping

Some characters need to be escaped within a dynamically expanded
string `%{...}`. The `%` character is used for variable expansion, so a
literal `%` character can be created by using `%%`.

Other than within a dynamically expanded string, very little
character escaping is needed. The rules of the enclosing string context
determine whether or not a space or " character needs to be escaped.

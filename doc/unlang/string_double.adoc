== Double Quoted Strings

`"string"`

A double-quoted string allows escape sequences and link:xlat.adoc[dynamic
expansions]. As with link:string_single.asoc[single-quoted strings], text
within double quotes can include spaces.

NOTE: Most values retrieved from external datastores will be treated implicitly
as double-quoted strings.

=== Escape sequences

Escape sequences allow the inclusion of characters that may be difficult to
represent in datastores, or the FreeRADIUS configuration files.

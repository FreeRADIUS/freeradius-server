== The foreach Statement

.Syntax
[source,unlang]
----
foreach <attribute-reference> {
    [ statements ]
}
----

The `foreach` statement loops over a list of attributes as given by
`<attribute-reference>`.  The loop can be exited early by using the
link:break.adoc[break] keyword.

Inside of the `foreach` block, the attribute that is being looped over
can be referenced as `Foreach-Variable-0`, through
`Foreach-Variable-9`.  The last digit is the depth of the loop,
starting at "0".  The loops can be nested up to eight (8) deep, though
this is not recommended.

The attributes being looped over cannot be modified or deleted.

.Example
[source,unlang]
----
foreach &Class {
    update reply {
        Reply-Message += "Contains %{Foreach-Variable-0}"
    }
}

= The load-balance Statement

[source,unlang]
----
load-balance [ <key> ] {
    [ statements ]
}
----

The `load-balance` section is similar to the `redundant` section
except that only one module in the subsection is ever called.

When the `<key>` field is omitted, the module is chosen randomly, in a
"load balanced" manner.

When the `<key>` field is present, it is expanded (if necessary), and
the resulting value is hashed.  The hash is then used to pick a
particular module.  This "keyed" load-balance can be used to
deterministically shard requests across multiple modules.

In general, the link:redundant-load-balance.adoc[redundant-load-balance]
statement is more useful than this one.

= The else Statement

.Syntax
[source,unlang]
----
if (condition) {
    [ statements ]
}
else {
    [ statements ]
}
----

An link:if.adoc[if] statement can have an `else` clause. If _condition_
evaluates to `false`, the statements in the link:if.adoc[if] subsection are skipped
and the statements within the `else` subsection are executed.

.Example
[source,unlang]
----
if (&User-Name == "bob") {
    reject
}
else {
    ok
}

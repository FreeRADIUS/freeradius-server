= The if Statement

.Syntax

----
if (condition) {
    [ statements ]
}

.Description
The `if` statement evaluates a link:condition.adoc[condition].  When the
_condition_ evaluates to `true`, the statements within the subsection
are executed.  When the _condition_ evaluates to `false`, those
statements are skipped.

An `if` statement can optionally be followed by an link:else.adoc[else] or
an link:elsif.adoc[elsif] statement.

.Example

if (&User-Name == "bob") {
    reject
}

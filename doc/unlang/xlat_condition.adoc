== Conditional Syntax

Conditional syntax similar to that used in Unix shells may also be
used:

`%{&#8203;%{Foo}:-bar}`

This code returns the value of `%{Foo}`, if it has a value.
Otherwise, it returns a literal string bar.

`%{&#8203;%{Foo}:-%{Bar}}`

This code returns the value of `%{Foo}`, if it has a value.
Otherwise, it returns the expansion of `%{Bar}`.

These conditional expansions can be nested to almost any depth, such
as with `%{&#8203;%{One}:-%{&#8203;%{Two}:-%{Three}}}`.

= The filter Statement

.Syntax
[source,unlang]
----
filter [ <list> ] {
	<server-attribute> <op> <value>
	...
}
----

The `filter` statement filters attributes in, the named _<list>_.
Attributes which do not match the filter conditions are removed.
Attributes that are not named in the `filter` section are unchanged.

The `filter` statement consists of the following syntax elements:

<list>:: The attribute list which will be filtered.  The list is
usually `request`, `reply`, or `control`.
+
If the _<list>_ qualifier is omitted, then each entry inside of the
`filter` section *must* be prefixed with a list name.  For example,
`&request:User-Name ...`

<server-attribute>:: The server attribute which is being filtered via the given
_<value>_.

<op>:: The operator such as `<`, `>=`, etc.

<value>:: The value which is used to filter the attribute.  If the
field is a double-quoted string, it undergoes link:xlat.adoc[string
expansion], and the resulting value is used to filter the attribute.

The change process is atomic, in that either all of the attributes are
modified, or none of them are modified.  If the `filter` fails for any
reason, then all of the results are discarded, and the `filter` does
not affect any server attributes.

.Example
[source,unlang]
----
filter reply {
	&Session-Timeout <= 3600
}
----

== Lists

The _<list>_ field sets the attribute list that will be filter.  If
the _<list>_ qualifier is omitted, then each entry inside of the
`filter` section *must* be prefixed with a list name.  For example,
`&request:User-Name ...`

Please see the link:list.adoc[list] page for valid list names.

== Server Attributes

The _<server-attribute>_ field is an attribute name, such as
`&Reply-Message`.  The attribute name may also be prefixed with a
_<list>_ qualifier, which overrides the _<list>_ given at the start
of the `filter` section.

NOTE: In version 3, the leading `&` was optional.  In version 4, the
leading `&` is required.

== Editing Operators

The `<op>` field is used to define how the values are filtered
Different operators allow attributes to be added, deleted, or
replaced, as defined below.

== Filtering Operators

The following operators may also be used in addition to the ones
listed above. These operators use the _<server-attribute>_ and
_<value>_ fields to enforce limits on all attributes in the given
_<list>_, and to edit attributes which have a matching
_<server-attribute>_ name. All other attributes are ignored.

.Filtering Operators
[options="header]
[cols="10%,90%"]
|=====
| Operator | Description
| -=       | Remove all attributes from the list that match _<value>_.
| ==       | Keep only the attributes in the list that match _<value>_
| <        | Keep only the attributes in the list that have values less than _<value>_.
| \<=      | Keep only the attributes in the list that have values less than or equal to _<value>_.
| >        | Keep only the attributes in the list that have values greater than _<value>_.
| >=       | Keep only the attributes in the list that have values greater than or equal to _<value>_.
| !*       | Delete all occurances of the attribute, no matter what the value.
| =~       | Keep only the attributes in the list which match the regular expression given in _<value>_.
| !~       | Keep only the attributes in the list which do not match the regular expression given in _<value>_.
|=====

The `==` operator is very different from the `=` operator listed
above. The `=` operator is used to add new attributes to the list,
while the `==` operator removes all attributes that do not match the
given value.

For IP addresses, the operators `>`, `>=`, `<`, and `<=` check for
membership in a network.  The _<value>_ field should then be a IP
network, given in `address/mask` format.

IMPORTANT: In version 3, some filtering operators would _create_ the
attribute if it did not exist in the destination list.  In version 4,
this functionality has been removed.  Instead, version 4 only performs
_filtering_ of the attributes.  That is, the filtering operators will
modify or delete attributes, but they will never create an attribute.

== Values

The _<value>_ field is the value which is used to filter the
_<server-attribute>_.  The interpretation of the _<value>_ field
depends on the data type of the contents.  For example, if the string
`"192.0.2.1"` is assigned to an attribute of the `string` data type,
then the result is an ASCII string containing that value.  However, if
the same string is assigned to an attribute of the `ipaddr` data type,
then the result is a 32-bit IPv4 address, with binary value
`0xc0000201`.

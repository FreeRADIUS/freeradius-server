== The update Statement

.Syntax
[source,unlang]
----
update [ <list> ] {
	<server-attribute> <op> <value>
	...
}
----

The `update` statement adds attributes to, or edits the attributes in,
the named _<list>_.

The `update` statement consists of the following syntax elements:

<list>:: The attribute list which will be updated.  The list is
usually `request`, `reply`, or `control`.
+
If the _<list>_ qualifier is omitted, then each entry inside of the
`update` section *must* be prefixed with a list name.  For example,
`&request:User-Name ...`

<server-attribute>:: The server attribute which is assigned the
_<value>_.

<op>:: The operator such as `=`, `:=`, etc.

<value>:: The value is expanded and the result is interpretted and
assigned.

The update process is atomic, in that either all of the attributes are
modified, or none of them are modified.  If the `update` fails for any
reason, then all of the results are discarded, and the `update` does
not affect any server attributes.

.Example
[source,unlang]
----
update reply {
   &Reply-Message := "Hello!"
   &Framed-IP-Address := 192.0.2.4
}
----

=== Lists

The _<list>_ field sets the attribute list that will be updated.  If
the _<list>_ qualifier is omitted, then each entry inside of the
`update` section *must* be prefixed with a list name.  For example,
`&request:User-Name ...`

Allow values for the _<list>_ field are:

`request`:: Attributes in the incoming request packet.

`reply`:: Attributes in the outgoing reply packet.

`control`:: Attributes in the internal "control" list that is
associated with the request.
+
The `control` attributes are used to manage how the request is
processed.  These attributes are never sent in any packet.

`session-state`:: Attributes which are maintained across multi-packet
exchanges.

There must be a colon `:` after the list name and before the attribute name.
This syntax helps the server to distinguish between list names and attribute
names.

NOTE: In version 3, there were additional lists such as `proxy`,
`proxy-reply`, and `coa`.  These lists have been removed in version 4.
See the link:subrequest.adoc[subrequest] statement for how to create
child requests.

With the exception of `session-state`, all of the above lists are
ephemeral.  That is, they exist for one packet exchange, and only one
packet exchange.  When a reply is sent for a request, the above lists
and all attributes are deleted.  There is no way to reference an
attribute from a previous packet.  We recommend using a database to
track complex state.

In some cases, requests are associated a multi-packet exchange.  For
those situations, the `session-state` list is automatically saved when
a reply is sent, and it is automatically restored when the next packet
in sequence comes in.  Once the packet exchange has been finished, the
`session-state` list is deleted.

In some cases, there is a parent-child relationship between requests.
In those situations, it is possible for the policy rules in the child
to refer to attributes in the parent.  This reference can be made by
prefixing the _<list>_ name with the `parent` qualifier.  The key word
`outer` is also a synonym for `parent`.  If there are multiple
parent-child relationships, the `parent` qualifier can be repeated.

There is, however, no way for the parent to refer to the child.  When
the child is running, the parent is suspended.  Once the child
finishes, it is deleted, and is no longer accessible to the parent.

.Examples
* `&parent.request:User-Name`
* `&parent.reply:Reply-Message`
* `&parent.parent.session-state:Filter-Id`

=== Server Attributes

The _<server-attribute>_ field is an attribute name, such as
`&Reply-Message`.  The attribute name may also be prefixed with a
_<list>_ qualifier, which overrides the _<list>_ given at the start
of the `update` section.

NOTE: In version 3, the leading `&` was optional.  In version 4, the
leading `&` is required.

=== Editing Operators

The `<op>` field is used to define how the attribute is processed.
Different operators allow attributes to be added, deleted, or
replaced, as defined below.

.Editing Operators
[options="header"]
[cols="10%,90%"]
|=====
| Operator | Description
| =        | Add the attribute to the list, if and only if an attribute of
the same name is not already present in that list.
| :=       | Add the attribute to the list. If any attribute of the same
name is already present in that list, its value is replaced with the
value of the current attribute.
| +=       | Add the attribute to the tail of the list, even if attributes
of the same name are already present in the list.
|=====

.Example
[source,unlang]
----
update reply {
   &Session-timeout := 86400
}
----

.Example
[source,unlang]
----
update reply {
   &Reply-Message += "Rejected: Also, realm does not end with ac.uk"
}
----

=== Filtering Operators

The following operators may also be used in addition to the ones
listed above. These operators use the _<server-attribute>_ and
_<value>_ fields to enforce limits on all attributes in the given
_<list>_, and to edit attributes which have a matching
_<server-attribute>_ name. All other attributes are ignored.

.Filtering Operators
[options="header]
[cols="10%,90%"]
|=====
| Operator | Description
| -=       | Remove all attributes from the list that match _<value>_.
| ==       | Keep only the attributes in the list that match _<value>_
| <        | Keep only the attributes in the list that have values less than _<value>_.
| \<=      | Keep only the attributes in the list that have values less than or equal to _<value>_.
| >        | Keep only the attributes in the list that have values greater than _<value>_.
| >=       | Keep only the attributes in the list that have values greater than or equal to _<value>_.
| !*       | Delete all occurances of the attribute, no matter what the value.
|=====

The `==` operator is very different from the `=` operator listed
above. The `=` operator is used to add new attributes to the list,
while the `==` operator removes all attributes that do not match the
given value.

For IP addresses, the operators `>`, `>=`, `<`, and `<=` check for
membership in a network.  The _<value>_ field should then be a IP
network, given in `address/mask` format.

IMPORTANT: In version 3, some filtering operators would _create_ the
attribute if it did not exist in the destination list.  In version 4,
this functionality has been removed.  Instead, version 4 only performs
_filtering_ of the attributes.  That is, the filtering operators will
modify or delete attributes, but they will never create an attribute.

=== Values

The _<value>_ field is the value which is assigned to the
_<server-attribute>_.  The interpretation of the _<value>_ field
depends on the data type of the contents.  For example, if the string
`"192.0.2.1"` is assigned to an attribute of the `string` data type,
then the result is an ASCII string containing that value.  However, if
the same string is assigned to an attribute of the `ipaddr` data type,
then the result is a 32-bit IPv4 address, with binary value `0xc0000201`.

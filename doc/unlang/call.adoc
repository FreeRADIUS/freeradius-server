= The call Statement

[source,unlang]
----
call <server> {
    [ statements ]
}
----

The `call` statement will create a child request, as with the
link:subrequest.adoc[subrequest] keyword.  This child request will be
an identical copy of the parent request, as with the
link:parallel.adoc[parallel] keyword.

<server>::  The virtual server which wil process the child request.
+
The called virtual server must have the same `namespace` value as the
calling virtual server.
+
The called virtual server will execute the subrequest as if it had
been received from the network.  For example, if the packet is a
RADIUS `Access-Request`, then the called virtual server will process
the `recv Access-Request` section, followed by the `authenticate
<type>` section, followed by the `send Access-Accept` section.

[ statements ]:: Once the called virtual server has finished, the _[
statements]_ from inside of the `call` section will be executed.
These statements will be executed in the context of the child.

The child requests are are freed once the _[ statements ]_ are
finished.  Any information stored in the child request is discarded.
Information that is needed after the `call` section is run should be
saved in the parent request.

NOTE: The statements inside of a `call` section are executed in the
context of the _child_ request, and not in the context of the _parent_
request.

The statements inside of the `call` section allow policies which copy
attributes from the child to the parent.  For example, a reply
`Packet-Type`, IP address assignment, or other results.

The return code of the `call` statement is taken from the return code
of the child request.

.Example

This example calls the `inner-tunnel` virtual server, and then copies
the resulting `Packet-Type` back to the parent request.

[source,unlang]
----
call inner-tunnel {
    update parent.reply {
        &Packet-Type := "%{reply:Packet-Type}"
    }
}

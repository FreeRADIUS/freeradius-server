= The return Statement

.Syntax
[source,unlang]
----
return
----

The `return` statement is used to exit a processing section such as
`recv Access-Request`.  It behaves similarly to the link:break.adoc[break] statement,
except that it is not limited to being used inside of a
link:foreach.adoc[foreach] loop.

The `return` statement is not strictly necessary.  It is mainly used
to simplify the layout of `unlang` policies.  If the `return`
statement did not exist, then every link:if.adoc[if] statement might need
to have a matching link:else.adoc[else] statement.

.Example
[source,unlang]
----
sql
if (&reply:Filter-Id == "hello") {
    return
}
...

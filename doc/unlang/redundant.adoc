== The redundant Statement

[source,unlang]
----
redundant {
    [ statements ]
}
----

The `redundant` section executes a series of statements in sequence.
As soon as one statement succeeds, the rest of the section is skipped.

All of the modules in the list should be the same type (e.g., `ldap`
or `sql`). All of the modules in the list should behave identically,
otherwise different requests will be processed through different
modules and will give different results.

In general, it is recommended to use the
link:redundant-load-balance.adoc[redundant-load-balance] statement instead
of `redundant`.

.Example
[source,unlang]
----
redundant {
    sql1
    sql2
    sql3

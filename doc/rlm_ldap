1.   INSTALATION

This module depends on OpenLDAP v2.x SDK libraries.
For details on obtaining source of OpenLDAP look at <http://www.openldap.org>.
OpenLDAP SDK in turn depends on OpenSSL crypto libraries and (optionaly) on 
Cyrus-SASL libraries.

2. CONFIGURATION

Add following subsection to the modules{} section of radiusd.conf to control
the rlm_ldap module:

  modules {
	...
	
	ldap {

#	server: LDAP server hostname/ip address
#
#	Optionaly could contain space separated list of host[:port],
#	but redundancy/resiliency is better acheived configuring multiple 
#	rlm_ldap module instances and invocing them in	redundand/failover
#	configuration in authorize/authenticate sections
#		
#	default: settings for your system, as set in etc/openldap/ldap.conf
#
		server   = localhost

#	port: LDAP server port
#		
#	If LDAP server port is set to 636 (ldaps), SSL connection is enforced.
#	This feature is useful for LDAP servers which support SSL, but don't
#	do TLS negotiation (like Novell eDirectory).
#	
#	default: 389 (ldap)
#
		port = 636

#	net_timeout: # of seconds to wait for response of the server 
#			(network failures)
#	default: 10
#
		net_timeout = 1

#	timeout: # seconds to wait for LDAP query to finish
#	default: 20
#
		timeout = 2

#	timelimit: # of seconds server has to process the query 
#			(server-side time limit)
#	default: 20
#
		timelimit = 5

#	ldap_debug: debug flag for LDAP SDK (see OpenLDAP documentation)
#	default: 0x0000 (no debugging messages)
#	Example:(LDAP_DEBUG_FILTER+LDAP_DEBUG_CONNS)
		ldap_debug = 0x0028 

#	identity: DN under which LDAP searches are done
#	password: pasword which authenticate this DN
#	default: anonymous bind, no password required
#	NOTE: searches are done now over unencrypted connection!
#
#	identity = "cn=admin,o=My Org,c=UA"
#	password = mypass

#	ldap_cache_timeout: The timeout for the ldap cache in secs
#	If it is set to zero then ldap caching will be disabled
#	default: 0 (disabled)

	ldap_cache_timeout = 0

#	ldap_cache_size: The maximum ldap cache size. If it is set to zero
#	then the ldap cache size will be unlimited
#	default: 0

	ldap_cache_size = 0

#	ldap_connections_number: The number of ldap connections that the module
#	will keep open to use in requests. Usually it will not need to be larger
#	than 5-10 connections
#	default: 5

	ldap_connections_number = 5

#	basedn = <Base of LDAP searches>
#
		basedn   = "o=My Org,c=UA"

#	filter: LDAP search filter, to locate user object using name
#	supplied by client during Radius authentication
#	
#	default: 
#		filter   = "(uid=%u)"

#	default_profile: DN of a LDAP object, which contains default RADIUS 
#	attributes. 
#	default: NULL - use only user specific attributes or attributes, 
#	supplied by other modules.
#		
	default_profile = "cn=RadProfile,o=My Org,c=UA"

#	profile_attribute: user object attribute, which contains DN of 
#	radiusProfile object for this user.
#	default: NULL - use only user specific attributes or attributes,
#       supplied by other modules.
#
#	profile_attribute = "radiusProfileDn"

#	access_attr_used_for_allow: Define if the access attribute (described below) will be
#	used to allow access (meaning if it exists then user remote access will be allowed)
#	or to deny access.
#	default: yes - used to allow access

#	access_attr: if attribute is specified, module checks for its existance
#	in user object.
#	If access_attr_used_for_allow is set to yes:
#	  If it exists the user is allowed to get remote access.
#	  If it exists and is set to FALSE the user is denied remote access.
#	  If it does not exist user is denied remote access by default
#	if access_attr_used_for_allow is set to no:
#	  If it exists the user is denied remote access.
#	  If it does not exist user is allowed remote access.
#	default: NULL - don't check for the attribute
		access_attr = "dialupAccess"

#	password_header: If the user password is available we add it to the check items
#	(to assist in CHAP ie) striping any headers first.
#	default: NULL
#
#	password_header = "{clear}"

#	password_attribute: Define the attribute which contains the user password.
#	default: NULL - don't add password
#
#	password_attribute = "userPassword"

#	groupname_attribute: The attribute used for searching for a group in the ldap server.
#	default: cn - Search filter is "(cn=%GroupName)"
#
#	groupname_attribute = "cn"

#	compare_check_items: Specifies if the module will do a comparison on the check items extracted
#	from the ldap with the corresponding items present in the incoming request.
#	default: no - don't do any comparisons
#
#	compare_check_items = yes
	

#	groupmembership_filter: The filter to search for group membership of a particular user
#	after we have found the DN for the group.
#	default: (|(&(objectClass=GroupOfNames)(member=%{Ldap-UserDn}))(&(objectClass=GroupOfUniqueNames)(uniquemember=%{Ldap-UserDn})))
#
#	groupmembership_filter = "(|(&(objectClass=GroupOfNames)(member=%{Ldap-UserDn}))(&(objectClass=GroupOfUniqueNames)(uniquemember=%{Ldap-UserDn})))"	


#	groupmembership_attribute: The attribute in the user entry that states the group the user belongs to.
#	The attribute can either contain the group name or the group DN. If it contains the group DN 
#	groupname_attribute will also be used to find the group's name. The attribute will be used after a search
#	based on the groupname_attribute and groupmembership_filter has failed.
#	default: NULL - don't search for a group based on attributes in the user entry.
#
#	groupmembership_attribute = "memberof"

	}
}

NOTE:
As LDAP is case insensitive, you should probably also set "lower_user = yes" 
and "lower_time = before" in main section of radiusd.conf, to get limits on 
simultaneous logins working correctly. Otherwise, users will be able get large 
number of sessions, capitalizing parts of their login names.

MODULE MESSAGES:
On user rejection rlm_ldap will return the following module messages:

"rlm_ldap: User not found"
"rlm_ldap: Access Attribute denies access"
"rlm_ldap: Bind as user failed"

These messages will be visible in radius.log as aditional information in
"Login incorrect" and "Invalid user" log messages.

LDAP XLAT:
The ldap module now supports LDAP URLs in xlat strings. That is you can now
add LDAP URLs in the configuration options and hopefully shortly also in the
users file. The strings will be of the following form:

%{ldap:ldap:///dc=company,dc=com?uid?sub?uid=%u}

The requested attributes list MUST contain only ONE attribute. In case this attribute
is multi valued which value is returned is considered UNDEFINED.
Also, adding the host:port information SHOULD be avoided unless there are more than one
ldap module instances in which case the host,port information can be used to distinguish
which module will actually return the information (the xlat function will return NULL if
the host,port information does not correspond to the configured attributes).
If there are more than one instances the module instance name can be used instead of the
string 'ldap' before the ldap url to decide which instance will return the information.
That is the xlat string will be of the form:

%{$instance_name:ldap:///dc=comapny,dc=com?uid?sub?uid=%u}

ie: ${ldap_company1:ldap:///dc=company1,dc=com?uid?sub?uid=%u}



USER PROFILE ATTRIBUTE:
The module can use the User-Profile attribute. If it is set, it will assume that it contains
the DN of a profile entry containing radius attributes. This entry will _replace_ the default
profile directive. That way we can use different profiles based on checks on the radius attributes
contained in the Access-Request packets. For example (users file):

DEFAULT	Service-Type == Outbound-User, User-Profile := "uid=outbound-dialup,dc=company,dc=com"
 

GROUP SUPPORT:
The module supports searching for ldap groups by use of the Ldap-Group attribute. As long as the module
has been instanciated it can be used to do group membership checks through other modules. For example in
the users file:

DEFAULT	Ldap-Group == "disabled", Auth-Type := Reject
	Reply-Message = "Sorry, you are not allowed to have dialup access"

DIRECTORY COMPATIBILITY NOTE:
If you use LDAP only for authorization and authentication (e.g. you can not
 afford schema extention), I propose to set all necessary attributes in 
raddb/users file with following authorize section of radiusd.conf :

authorize { 
	ldap {
		notfound = return
	} 
	files  
}

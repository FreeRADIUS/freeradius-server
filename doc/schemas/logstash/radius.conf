# logstash configuration to process RADIUS detail files
#
# Matthew Newton
# February 2014
# 
# RADIUS "detail" files are textual representations of the RADIUS
# packets, and are written to disk by e.g. FreeRADIUS. They look
# something like the following, with the timestamp on the first
# line then all attributes/values tab-indented.
#

#		Packet-Type = Access-Request
#		User-Name = "test@example.com"
#		Calling-Station-Id = "01-02-03-04-05-06"
#		Called-Station-Id = "aa-bb-cc-dd-ee-ff:myssid"
#		NAS-Port = 10
#		NAS-IP-Address = 10.9.0.4
#		NAS-Identifier = "Wireless-Controller-1"
#		Service-Type = Framed-User
#		NAS-Port-Type = Wireless-802.11
#
# This filter processes the detail file such that each attribute
# is stored as a separate field in the output document.

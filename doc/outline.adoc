If you're in the "wrong" place, then that documentation can link to
the "right" one.  i.e. documentation for the LDAP module syntax can
link to a "howto" for configuring LDAP, and vice versa.

Each page should also be answering the question of "if this _isn't_
what the user wanted to see, quickly direct them to the _correct_
place".  This is usually done with in-line links, instead of explicit
text.  For example, "this is the _LDAP_ Howto".  Where "LDAP" is a
link to the LDAP module reference documentation.

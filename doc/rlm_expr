	Expression Module Configuration

0. INTRODUCTION

  The expression module (rlm_expr) allows the server to perform
limited mathematical calculations.  It is enabled by default in
radiusd.conf, so there's nothing special you have to do to use it.


1. USAGE

  The expression module is used via the dynamic translation of
strings.  (See 'variables.txt' in this directory for more
information).  For example, some NAS boxes send a NAS-Port attribute
which is a 32-bit number composed of port, card, and interface, all in
different bytes.  To see these attributes split into pieces, you can
do something like:

DEFAULT
	Vendor-Interface-Number = `%{expr: %{NAS-Port} / (256 * 256)}`,
	Vendor-Card-Number += `%{expr: (%{NAS-Port} / 256) %% 256}`,
	Vendor-Port-Number += `%{expr: %{NAS-Port} %% 256}`

  where the attributes Vendor-Interface-Number, Vendor-Card-Number,
and Vendor-Port-Number are attributes created by either you or the
vendor-supplied dictionary.


2. MATHEMATICAL OPERATORS

  The methematical operators supported by the expression module are:

	+	addition
	-	subtraction
	/	division
	%%	modulo remainder
	*	multiplication
	&	boolean AND
	|	boolean OR
	()	grouping of sub-expressions.


  Note that the modulo remainder operator is '%%', and not '%'.  This
is due to the '%' character being used as a special character for
dynamic translation.

  Note also that these operators do NOT have precedence.  The parsing
of the input string, and the calculation of the answer, is done
strictly left to right.  If you wish to order the expressions, you
MUST group them into sub-expression, as shown in the previous
example.

  All of the calculations are performed as unsigned 32-bit integers.

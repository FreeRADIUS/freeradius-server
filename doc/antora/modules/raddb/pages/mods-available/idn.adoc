= IDN Module

The `idn` (Internationalised domain names) encoding for DNS aka IDNA
standardized in https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3490[RFC 3490].

[NOTE]
====
The expansion string: `%{idn:example.com}` results in an ASCII
punycode version of the domain name.  That version can then be used
for name comparisons.  Using an `i18n` version of the name is *NOT
RECOMMENDED*, as that version is not canonical.

i.e. the `same` domain name can be represented in many, many,
different ways.  Only the `idn` version has *one* representation.

= Always Module

The `always` module simply returns the same result, always, without
doing anything else.  It is here for use in complex policies.

The main configuration item is `rcode`, which sets the return  code that
this  instantiation  of  the  module  will return. The default, if none
specified, is 'fail'.



## Syntax


rcode:: Return code.

The `rcode` may be one of the following values:

[options="header,autowidth"]
|===
| Parameter  | Description
| `reject`   | Reject the user.
| `fail`     | Simulate or indicate a failure.
| `ok`       | Simulate or indicate a success.
| `handled`  | Indicate that the request has been handled,
               stop processing, and send response if set.
| `invalid`  | Indicate that the request is invalid.
| `disallow` | Indicate that the user account has been
               locked out.
| `notfound` | Indicate that a user account can't be found.
| `noop`     | Simulate a no-op.
| `updated`  | Indicate that the request has been updated.
|===



simulcount::

If an instance of this module is listed in a `session {}`
section, this simulates a user having `<integer>` number of sessions.



mpp::

If an instance is listed in a `session {}` section, this
simulates the user having multilink sessions.



## xlat for peeking and poking the status

An xlat based on the instance name can be called to change the status
returned by the instance.

.Example

```
%{db_status:ok}
%{db_status:fail}
%{db_status:notfound}
...
```

The above xlats expand to the current status of the module. To fetch the
current status without affecting it call the xlat with an empty argument:

.Example

```
%{db_status:}
```



## Configuration Settings

The following default instances allow the use of return codes like
`reject` or `ok` in `unlang` policies.


== Default Configuration

```
#always <name> {
#	rcode = <value>
#	simulcount = <integer>
#	mpp = <integer>
#}
always reject {
	rcode = reject
}
always fail {
	rcode = fail
}
always ok {
	rcode = ok
}
always handled {
	rcode = handled
}
always invalid {
	rcode = invalid
}
always disallow {
	rcode = disallow
}
always notfound {
	rcode = notfound
}
always noop {
	rcode = noop
}
always updated {
	rcode = updated
}
```

= SQL-IP-Pool Module

The module `sqlippool` provide configuration for the SQL based IP Pool module.

NOTE: The database schemas are available at `raddb/sql/ippool/<DB>/schema.sql`.

## Configuration Settings


sql_module_instance:: SQL instance to use (from `raddb/mods-available/sql`)

If you have multiple sql instances, such as `sql sql1 {...}`,
use the *instance* name here: `sql1`.



dialect:: This is duplicative of info available in the SQL module, but
we have to list it here as we do not yet support nested
reference expansions.



ippool_table:: SQL table to use for ippool range and lease info.



lease_duration:: IP lease duration. (Leases expire even if `Acct Stop` packet is lost).



attribute_name:: Attribute to use for querying / updating IP addresses.

[NOTE]
====
It MUST be a qualified name of an attribute of a type which contains IP addresses.

e.g. `ipaddr`, `ipv4prefix,` `ipv6addr`, or `ipv6prefix`.
====



pool_key:: Attribute which should be considered unique per NAS.

  * Using `link:https://freeradius.org/rfc/rfc2865.html#NAS-Port[NAS-Port]` gives behaviour similar to `rlm_ippool` and ACS. (default).
  * Using `link:https://freeradius.org/rfc/rfc2865.html#Calling-Station-Id[Calling-Station-Id]` works for NAS that send fixed `link:https://freeradius.org/rfc/rfc2865.html#NAS-Port[NAS-Port]`.

WARNING: ONLY change this if you know what you are doing!



messages { ... }:: These messages are added to the `control::` items, as
`Module-Success-Message`. They are not logged anywhere else, unlike
previous versions.
If you want to have them logged to a file, see the `linelog` module,
and create an entry which writes `Module-Success-Message` message.

WARNING: MySQL (MyISAM) has certain limitations that means it can hand out
the same IP address to 2 different users.
  *We suggest* using an SQL DB with proper transaction support, such as PostgreSQL,
or using MySQL with InnoDB.







.Load the queries from a separate file.

	pool_key = "%{NAS-Port}"
	messages {

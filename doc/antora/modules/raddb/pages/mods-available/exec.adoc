= Exec Module

The module `exec` is used for executing external programs.

This module is useful only for `xlat`.  To use it, put `exec` into
the `instantiate` section.  You can then do dynamic translation of
attributes like:

  Attribute-Name = "%{exec:/path/to/program args}"

The value of the attribute will be replaced with the output of the
program which is executed.  Due to RADIUS protocol limitations,
any output over `253` bytes will be ignored.

The RADIUS attributes from the user request will be placed
into environment variables of the executed program, as
described in `man unlang` and in `doc/unlang/xlat.adoc`

The return value of the program run determines the result of the exec
instance call as follows:

[options="header,autowidth"]
|===
| Code | Return    | Description
| < 0  | fail      | the module failed.
| = 0  | ok        | the module succeeded.
| = 1  | reject    | the module rejected the user.
| = 2  | fail      | the module failed.
| = 3  | ok        | the module succeeded.
| = 4  | handled   | the module has done everything to handle the request.
| = 5  | invalid   | the user's configuration entry was invalid.
| = 6  | disallow  | the user was locked out.
| = 7  | notfound  | the user was not found.
| = 8  | noop      | the module did nothing.
| = 9  | updated   | the module updated information in the request.
| > 9  | fail      | the module failed.
|===



## Configuration Settings


wait:: Wait for the program to finish.

If we do NOT wait, then the program is "fire and
forget", and any output attributes from it are ignored.



program:: The name of the program to execute, and it's
arguments.

Dynamic translation is done on this field, so things like
the following example will work.

If 'program' is set to a value, then the module *cannot* be
used in an `xlat`.  See the `echo` module for examples of
how to use the module "in line".



input_pairs:: The attributes which are placed into the
environment variables for the program.

Allowed values are:

[options="header,autowidth"]
|===
| Pairs         | Description
| request       | attributes from the request
| config        | attributes from the configuration items list
| reply         | attributes from the reply
| session-state | attributes that persist over multiple request/response rounds.
|===



output_pairs::: Where to place the output attributes (if any) from
the executed program.

The values allowed, and the restrictions as to availability, are the
same as for the `input_pairs`.

This configuration item is used only when the `program`
configuration item is set, and when `wait = yes` is set.



shell_escape:: Escape the environment variables.

If this is set, all the RADIUS attributes are capitalised and dashes
replaced with underscores. Also, RADIUS values are surrounded with
double-quotes.

That is to say:

  User-Name=BobUser => USER_NAME="BobUser"



timeout:: Set a time wait for the program to finish.

Default is `10` seconds, which should be plenty for nearly
anything. Range is `1` to `30` seconds.

WARNING: You are strongly encouraged to NOT increase this
value.  In fact, you are much better off decreasing it to a
lower value.  Doing so will improve network stability and
responsiveness.


== Default Configuration

```
exec {
	wait = yes
#	program = "/bin/true %{User-Name}"
	input_pairs = request
#	output_pairs = reply
	shell_escape = yes
	timeout = 10
}
```

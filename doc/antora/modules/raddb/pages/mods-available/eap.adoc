= EAP Module

The `eap` module takes care of all EAP authentication as described in https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3579[RFC 3579].

[WARNING]
====
Whatever you do, do NOT set 'Auth-Type := EAP'.  The server is smart enough
to figure this out on its own.

The most common side effect of setting 'Auth-Type := EAP' is that the users
then cannot use ANY other authentication method.
====



## Configuration Settings


require_identity_realm:: Require the the EAP Identity provided contains
a realm.

If `require_identity_realm` is `nai`, the EAP identity provided must
end with `@<label0>.<label1>[.<labelN>]`, i.e. an '@' followed by at least
two DNS labels.

If `require_identity_realm` is `yes`, the EAP identity provided must
either match the NAI format described above, or a `Stripped-User-Domain`
attribute must be present in the request list.
This validation mode is intended to be user where Windows machine
authentication is intermixed with user authentication.

If `require_identity_realm` is `no`, no identity format checks are performed.
It is NOT recommended to use this value.  Future security standards will
key off the NAI realm to validate the certificate we (the EAP server) present.
If you do not require an NAI realm be present in the EAP identity string,
your users will not be able to take advantage of this added security when
it is enabled by OS and device vendors.



default_eap_type:: The default EAP submodule to invoke when an `EAP-Identity`
response is received.

If a `default_eap_type` value is not provided, enabled EAP submodules will be
queried to determine if they recognise the provided EAP-Identity.
If no submodules recognise the identity, the first `type` value listed below
will be used.

If the `control.EAP-Type` attribute is set, then that EAP type takes precedence
over any configured or inferred EAP-Type.

It is generally recommended to NOT set `default_eap_type`, and instead order
the `type` configuration items appropriately.



ignore_unknown_eap_types::

There are many EAP types, but the server has support for only a
limited subset.  If the server receives a request for an EAP type it
does not support, then it normally rejects the request.  By setting
this configuration to `yes`, you can tell the server to instead keep
processing the request.  Another module MUST then be configured to
proxy the request to another RADIUS server which supports that EAP
type.

NOTE: If another module is NOT configured to handle the request, then the
request will still end up being rejected.



## Allowed EAP-types

type:: Only EAP types listed below with a `type = <EAP-Type>` pair will be allowed.



### EAP-MD5

WARNING: EAP-MD5 authentication cannot be used for wireless
connections.  It is insecure, and does not provide for dynamic WEP
keys or WPA enterprise.




### EAP-PWD (Secure password-based authentication)

In v4, the "known good" password is taken from the `&request.control.Password.Cleartext` list,
as is done by other modules. The change from v3 is that the `inner-tunnel` virtual server
is no not used.




fragment_size:: This has the same meaning as for TLS.



### Generic Token Card

Currently, this is only permitted inside of `EAP-TTLS`, or `EAP-PEAP`.
The module `challenges` the user with text, and the response from the
user is taken to be the `link:https://freeradius.org/rfc/rfc2865.html#User-Password[User-Password]`.

WARNING: Proxying the tunneled `EAP-GTC` session is a bad idea, the users
password will go over the wire in plain-text, for anyone to see.


challenge:: The default challenge, which many clients ignore.



auth_type::

The plain-text response which comes back is put into a
`link:https://freeradius.org/rfc/rfc2865.html#User-Password[User-Password]` attribute, and passed to another module for
authentication.  This allows the `EAP-GTC` response to be
checked against plain-text, or crypt'd passwords.

If you say "Local" instead of "PAP", then the module will
look for a `link:https://freeradius.org/rfc/rfc2865.html#User-Password[User-Password]` configured for the request, and do
the authentication itself.



## Common TLS configuration for TLS-based EAP types

See `doc/raddb/certs/index.adoc` for additional comments on certificates.

If OpenSSL was not found at the time the server was built, the `tls`,
`ttls`, and `peap` sections will be ignored.

If you do not currently have certificates signed by a trusted CA you
may use the 'snakeoil' certificates. Included with the server in
`raddb/certs`.

If these certificates have not been auto-generated:

  cd raddb/certs
  make

These test certificates *SHOULD NOT* be used in a normal
deployment.  They are created only to make it easier to
install the server, and to perform some simple tests with
EAP-TLS, TTLS, or PEAP.

Note that you should NOT use a globally known CA here!
e.g. using a Verisign cert as a "known CA" means that
ANYONE who has a certificate signed by them may be able to
authenticate via EAP-TLS!  This is likely not what you
want.


[NOTE]
====
As of 4.0 the following TLS config items/config sections have been
removed.  Equivalent functionality is available.

[options="header,autowidth"]
|===
| Config item | Replacement

| `verify_client_cert_cmd`
| Unlang policy in the `verify certificate { ... }` section of the specified `virtual_server`.

| `check_cert_issuer`
| Unlang policy in the `verify certificate { ... }` section of the specified `virtual_server`.

| `check_cert_cn`
| Unlang policy in the `verify certificate { ... }` section of the specified `virtual_server`.

| `ocsp`
| rlm_ocsp call in the `verify certificate { ... }` section of the specified `virtual_server`.

| `staple`
| rlm_ocsp call in the `staple certificate { ... }` section of the specified `virtual_server`.
|===


virtual_server::

All certificate checks and stateful session resumption calls will be
made to the virtual server specified here.

The virtual server must specify `namespace = tls`, and may contain
the following sections:

[options="header,autowidth"]
|===
| Section | Purpose

| `load session { ... }`
| Load stateful session information from a cache.

| `store session { ... }`
| Store stateful session information in a cache.

| `clear session { ... }`
| Clear stateful session information from a cache.

| `verify certificate { ... }` |
| Apply policies based on the client certificate presented.

| `staple certificate { ... }`
| Gather stapling information for one or more of our certificates.
|===

More information about the various sections can be found in
link:../sites-available/tls.adoc[sites-available/tls].


auto_chain::

OpenSSL will automatically create certificate chains, unless
we tell it to not do that.  The problem is that it sometimes
gets the chains right from a certificate signature view, but
wrong from the clients view.

NOTE: When setting `auto_chain = no`, the server `chain {}`
section(s) below MUST include the full certificate chain.



.A chain of certificates to present to the client

Multiple chain sections can be specified to allow different
chains for different key types (RSA, DSA, DH, EC).

If multiple chains for the same key type are specified
the last chain to be processed will be used for that
key type.

WARNING: The chain selected is based on the cipher
agreed by the client and server. Therefore, for example,
if the client includes EC ciphers in its proposal, but
only has an RSA certificate, then the authentication is
likely to fail as cipher negotiation can select an EC
cipher.

The key type does not need to be explicitly specified as
it is determined from the certificate provided.


format:: The format of the certificate(s) and private key file.

May be one of `PEM`, `DER` or `ASN1` (ASN1 is an alias for `DER`).



certificate_file:: File which contains the certificate presented
by the EAP module to the client.

If PEM is being used the `certificate_file` specified below
should contain the server certificates, and any intermediary CAs
which are not available to the client.

[NOTE]
====
If `verify_mode` (below) is set to `hard` or `soft` all
intermediary CAs and the Root CA should be included.

Any certificate chain MUST be in order from server
certificate (first in the file) to intermediary CAs (second) to
Root CA (last in the file) as per https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4346#section-7.4.2[RFC 4346 Section 7.4.2] (see certificate_list)

If DER is being used the `certificate_file` should contain ONLY
the server's certificate, and one or more `ca_file` items should be
used to load intermediary CAs and the Root CA.
====

We recommend using `ca_file` to load the
root CAs, instead of putting them in
`certificate_file`.



ca_file::  File which contains the root CA.

Load an additional intermediary CA or Root CA for consideration in
chain compilation.  Multiple "ca_file" config items may be used
to load multiple certificates.

When multiple `ca_file` entries are used, the server will still present
only one `certificate_file` to the clients.  The main use for multiple
`ca_file` entries is to permit the use of EAP-TLS with client certificates
from multiple Root CAs.



private_key_password:: Password used to encrypt the private key.
If the private key is not encrypted, this configuration item
will have no effect.



private_key_file:: File which contains the private key.

If the Private key & Certificate are located in the same file,
then `private_key_file` & `certificate_file` must contain the
same file name.



verify_mode:: How we verify the certificate chain.

During startup we attempt to precompile the certificate chain
from server certificate to Root CA.  This configuration item specifies
what happens if compilation fails.

[options="header,autowidth"]
|===
| Error | Description
| hard  | Error out if we cannot build a complete certificate chain.
| soft  | Warn if we cannot build a complete certificate chain.
| none  | Stay silent if we cannot build a complete certificate chain.
|===

The default is `hard`.  The only time this should be changed is if
you want to limit the number of intermediary CAs sent to the
client by not including them in the chain.

[NOTE]
====
  * Depending on the value of `auto_chain` we may still be able to
  build a complete chain, but this will be done at runtime.

  * `auto_chain` has no effect on which certificates are considered
for pre-compilation.  Only those listed in this `chain {}` section
will be used.
====



include_root_ca:: Whether or not the root CA is included in the
certificate chain.

The Root CA should already be known/trusted by the client so it is
usually not needed unless the client is particularly poorly behaved.

NOTE: The Root CA must still be available for chain compilation to
succeed even if `include_root_ca = no`.

Default: `no`.



### ECC certificate chain for key agility

This is disabled by default, see the warning above.
If your supplicants propose a mix of different
types of ciphers and have all of the CA keys for
each type available, then multiple chains may be
enabled simultaneously.



## Server certificate

The server certificate may also be specified at
runtime on a per session basis.  In that use-case,
the certificate file must consist of the
certificate and private key, PEM encoded.  The
password should either be set above with
`password`, or the certificate should have no
password.

The file should be provided as the attribute:

    &control.TLS-Session-Cert-File

If there are any errors loading or verifying the
certificate, authentication will fail.

This configuration can be used to periodically
verify correct supplicant behaviour, by presenting
an untrusted or invalid server certificate and
verifying that the supplicant returns the correct
TLS alert (available in Module-Failure-Message).

NOTE: After receiving a fatal alert, TLS negotiation
cannot continue, but as most supplicants retry
enthusiastically this probably won't be an issue.



ca_file:: Trusted Root CA list

ALL of the CA's in this list will be trusted to issue client
certificates for authentication.

NOTE: You should not use a public CA here.  This should either be
set to a certificate chain for your institution's CA
or a self signed Root CA.
#


psk_identity:::

If OpenSSL supports TLS-PSK, then we can use a PSK identity
and (hex) password.

If using a fixed identity, it must be the same on
the client.  The passphrase must be a hex value,
and can be up to 256 hex characters.



WARNING: Dynamic queries for the `PSK`.  If `TLS-PSK` is used,
and `psk_query` is set, then you MUST NOT use
`psk_identity` or `psk_hexphrase`.



psk_query::

Instead, use a dynamic expansion similar to the one
below.  It keys off of TLS-PSK-Identity.  It should
return a of string no more than 512 hex characters.
That string will be converted to binary, and will
be used as the dynamic PSK hexphrase.

Note that this query is just an example.  You will
need to customize it for your installation.



For DH cipher suites to work, you have to run OpenSSL to
create the DH file first:

	openssl dhparam -out certs/dh 2048



fragment_size::

This can never exceed the size of a RADIUS packet (4096
bytes), and is preferably half that, to accommodate other
attributes in RADIUS packet.  On most APs the MAX packet
length is configured between `1500 - 1600` In these cases,
fragment size should be `1024` or less.



ca_path:: Full path to the CA file.



cipher_list::

Set this option to specify the allowed TLS cipher suites.
The format is listed in `man 1 ciphers`.

NOTE: For `EAP-FAST`, use "ALL:!EXPORT:!eNULL:!SSLv2"



cipher_server_preference::

If enabled, OpenSSL will use server cipher list
(possibly defined by cipher_list option above)
for choosing right cipher suite rather than
using client-specified list which is OpenSSl default
behavior. Having it set to 'yes' is best practice
for TLS.



tls_max_version::

[NOTE]
====
  * Work-arounds for OpenSSL nonsense.  OpenSSL 1.0.1f and 1.0.1g do
not calculate the `EAP` keys correctly.  The fix is to upgrade
OpenSSL, or to disable TLS 1.2 here.

  * SSLv2 and SSLv3 are permanently disabled due to security
issues.

  * We STRONGLY RECOMMEND that TLS 1.0 and TLS 1.1 be disabled.
They are insecure and SHOULD NOT BE USED.
====



tls_min_version::

[NOTE]
====
Prevents versions < tls_min_version from being negotiated.
In general the higher the tls_min_version the more secure
the protocol, but the narrower the range of supported TLS
clients.

SSLv2 and SSLv3 are permanently disabled due to security
issues.
====



ecdh_curve:: Elliptical cryptography configuration.

Should be a colon-separated list of curve names.

For supported curve names, please run the command:

openssl ecparam -list_curves



mode:: Which client certificates should be verified

[options="header,autowidth"]
|===
| Value | Description

| `disabled`
| Don't verify any certificates.

| `all`
| Verify all certificates.  Check none have been
  revoked via CRL, and that all are trusted.

| `untrusted`
| Verify all untrusted certificates,
  i.e. those which were presented by the client
  and not loaded on startup.

| `client-and-issuer`
| Verify the client certificate and its issuer.

| `client`
| Only verify the client certificate.
|===

It is recommended to leave mode as `all` except
when debugging, or in an emergency situation.

[NOTE]
====
This verification is only applied during a full
handshake, and with stateful session resumption.
Verification for stateless session resumption
should be performed using the `verify [*] { ... }`
section(s) of the specified `virtual_server`.
====



attribute_mode:: Which client certificates should
be converted to attributes for use in the
`verify * { ... }` sections of the specified
`virtual_server`.

Attributes created during certificate processing
will be placed in the `&session-state` list.
This is to simplify session-resumption, as the
contents of this list also contains session data
for stateful resumption, and this list is encoded
in the session-ticket for stateless resumption.

[options="header,autowidth"]
|===
| Value | Description

| `disabled`
| Don't produce any attributes.

| `all`
| Create attributes for all certificates from
  the root, to the presented client certificate.

| `untrusted`
| Create attributes for untrusted certificates,
  i.e. those which were presented by the client
  and not loaded on startup.

| `client-and-issuer`
| Create attributes for the client certificate
  and its issuer.
| `client`

| Only create attributes for the client
  certificate.
|===

[NOTE]
====
Attribute generation is only performed on full
handshake, or where we detect that attributes
are missing from the &session-state list during
stateful session-resumption.

Certificate attributes will usually be retrieved
from the the session-ticket in the case of
stateless session-resumption.
====



check_crl:: Check the Certificate Revocation List.

Will check CRLs for all certificates in the certificate chain.

1. Copy CA certificates and CRLs to same directory.
2. Execute `c_rehash <CA certs&CRLs Directory>`. `c_rehash` is
   OpenSSL's command.
3. uncomment the lines below.
4. Restart radiusd.



allow_expired_crl:: Accept an expired Certificate Revocation List.



allow_not_yet_valid_crl:: Accept a not-yet-valid Certificate Revocation List.



### TLS Session resumption

Once authentication has completed the TLS client may be
provided with a unique session identifier (stateful resumption)
or a session-ticket (stateless resumption) that it may present
during its next authentication attempt.

Presenting a session identifier or session-ticket allows the
client to skip the majority of TLS tunnel setup during its next
authentication session.

Enabling `Session-Resumption` is highly recommended for sites
using slow authentication backends such as winbindd/Active
Directory, and for access federations operating over the
internet, such as Eduroam.

NOTE: You must ensure any attributes required for policy
decisions are cached at the same time as the TLS session
data. This is usually done by placing policy attributes in the
`&session-state` list, or in the case of EAP-PEAP, EAP-TTLS and
EAP-FAST, the `&parent.session-state` list (i.e. in the request
that represents the TLS part of the authentication attempt),
so that they are cached at the same time as the session resumption
data.


mode:: What type of session caching should be allowed.

[options="header,autowidth"]
|===
| Value | Description

| `disabled`
| Don't allow any kind of session resumption.

| `stateful`
| Use <= TLS 1.2 style stateful session resumption.
  A unique session-identifier is provided to the client.
  The client provides this identifier during the next
  authentication attempt, and we lookup session information
  based on this identifier.
  A `virtual_server` with `load session { ... }`,
  `store session { ... }` and `clear session { ... }`
  sections must be configured.

| `stateless`
| Allow session-ticket based resumption.  This requires no
  external support.  All information required for resumption
  is sent to the TLS client in an encrypted session-ticket.
  The client returns this ticket during the next
  authentication attempt.

| `auto`
| Choose an appropriate session resumption type based on
  the TLS version used and whether a `virtual_server` is
  configured and has the required `session` sections.
|===

It is recommended to set `mode = auto` *and* provide a
correctly configured `virtual_server`.  wpa_supplicant
does not request/allow session tickets by default for
TLS < 1.3.


name:: Name of the context TLS sessions are created under.

Qualifies TLS sessions so that they can't be used for
purposes for which they were not intended.

If you wish to share session resumption data between
multiple EAP modules/virtual servers they all must have
the same name value set.

To disable - set to a zero length string "".

NOTE: OpenSSL only allows 32 bytes of session ctx, so
the value provided here is digested with SHA256.



lifetime::

The period for which a resumable session remains valid.

Default is 24hrs inline with https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4346[RFC 4346].



require_extended_master_secret::

Only allow session resumption if an extended master
secret has been created.  This requires client support.

Extended Master Secrets (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7627[RFC 7627]) are required to
prevent MITM attacks, where the attacker can resume
a session if it can insert itself into the path between
the TLS client and TLS server.

See more at https://mitls.org/pages/attacks/3SHAKE

WARNING: This attack is undetectable by the client.



require_perfect_forward_secrecy::

Only allow session resumption if a cipher which would
allow perfect forward secrecy has been selected.



[NOTE]
====
As of 4.0 OpenSSL's internal cache has been disabled due to
scoping/threading issues.

The following configuration options are deprecated.  TLS
session caching is now handled by FreeRADIUS
either using session-tickets (stateless), or using TLS
`virtual_server` and storing/retrieving sessions to/from
an external datastore (stateful).

  * `enable`
  * `persist_dir`
  * `max_entries`
====



### EAP-TLS

As of Version 3.0, the TLS configuration for `TLS-based`
EAP types is above in the `tls-config { ... }` section.

Point to the common TLS configuration


require_client_cert::

`EAP-TLS` can work without a client certificate, but situations
whether this is useful are quite limited.

Currently only the Hotspot 2.0 R2 standard utilises `EAP-TLS`
without a peer certificate.

This is to secure the SSID used to provide connectivity to the OSU
(Online Signup Server).

You can override this option by setting:

  EAP-TLS-Require-Client-Cert = Yes/No

in the control items for a request.



include_length::

flag which is by default set to yes If set to `yes`,
Total length of the message is included in EVERY
packet we send. If set to `no`, Total length of the message is
included ONLY in the First packet of a fragment series.



### EAP-TTLS

The TTLS module implements the `EAP-TTLS` protocol, which can be
described as EAP inside of Diameter, inside of TLS, inside of EAP,
inside of RADIUS.

NOTE: To use `EAP-TTLS `you must also configure an `inner` method in
`mods-enabled/eap_inner`.

Surprisingly, it works quite well.

When using `PAP`, `GTC`, or `MSCAHPv2` as an inner method `EAP-TTLS` is
only secure if the supplicant is configured to validate the the
server certificate presented.

It is trivial to retrieve the user's credentials from these inner
methods, if the user connects to a rogue server.


tls::

Which `tls-config` section the TLS negotiation parameters
are in - see `EAP-TLS` above for an explanation.

In the case that an old configuration from FreeRADIUS
v2.x is being used, all the options of the `tls-config { ... }`
section may also appear instead in the 'tls' section
above. If that is done, the `tls=` option here (and in tls above)
MUST be commented out.



[WARNING]
====
Both `copy_request_to_tunnel` and `use_tunneled_reply` have been
removed in v4.0.

See the new policy `copy_request_to_tunnel` in
link:../sites-available/inner-tunnel.adoc[sites-available/inner-tunnel], and in `policy.d/eap`
for more information.
====



virtual_server::

The inner tunneled request can be sent through a virtual
server constructed specifically for this purpose.

If this entry is commented out, the inner tunneled request
will be sent through the virtual server that processed the
outer requests.



include_length::

This has the same meaning, and overwrites, the same field in
the `tls` configuration, above. The default value here is
`yes`.



require_client_cert::

`EAP-TTLS` does not require a client certificate.
However, you can require one by setting the
following option. You can also override this option by
setting

  EAP-TLS-Require-Client-Cert = Yes

in the control items for a request.

NOTE: The majority of supplicants do not support using a
client certificate with `EAP-TTLS`, so this option is unlikely
to be usable for most people.



### EAP-PEAP

The tunneled `EAP` session needs a default `EAP` type which is separate
from the one for the non-tunneled EAP module.  Inside of the TLS/PEAP
tunnel, we recommend using `EAP-MS-CHAPv2`.

When using `GTC`, or `MSCAHPv2` as an inner method, `PEAP` is only secure
if the supplicant is configured to validate the server certificate.

It is trivial to retrieve the user's credentials from these inner
methods, if the user connects to a rogue server.

#### Windows compatibility

[IMPORTANT]
====
  * If you see the server send an `link:https://freeradius.org/rfc/rfc2865.html#Access-Challenge[Access-Challenge]`, and the client never
sends another `link:https://freeradius.org/rfc/rfc2865.html#Access-Request[Access-Request]`, then	*STOP*!

  * The server certificate has to have special OID's in it, or else the
Microsoft clients will silently fail.  See the `scripts/xpextensions`
file for details, and the following page
http://support.microsoft.com/kb/814394/en-us .

  * For additional Windows XP SP2 issues,
see: http://support.microsoft.com/kb/885453/en-us

  * If is still doesn't work, and you're using Samba, you may be
encountering a Samba bug.
see: https://bugzilla.samba.org/show_bug.cgi?id=6563

  * Note that we do not necessarily agree with their explanation. but
the fix does appear to work.
====

NOTE: To use `EAP-TTLS` you must also configure an inner method in
`mods-enabled/eap_inner`.


tls::

Which `tls-config` section the TLS negotiation parameters are
in - see `EAP-TLS` above for an explanation.

In the case that an old configuration from FreeRADIUS v2.x is
being used, all the options of the `tls-config` section may
also appear instead in the `tls` section above. If that is
done, the tls= option here (and in tls above) MUST be
commented out.



default_eap_type::

The tunneled EAP session needs a default EAP type which is
separate from the one for the non-tunneled EAP module.
Inside of the PEAP tunnel, we recommend using MS-CHAPv2, as
that is the default type supported by Windows clients.



[NOTE]
====
Both `copy_request_to_tunnel` and `use_tunneled_reply` have been
removed in v4.0.

See the new policy `copy_request_to_tunnel` in
link:../sites-available/inner-tunnel.adoc[sites-available/inner-tunnel], and in `policy.d/eap`
for more information.
====



proxy_tunneled_request_as_eap::

When the tunneled session is proxied, the home server may not
understand `EAP-MSCHAP-V2`. Set this entry to `no` to proxy the
tunneled `EAP-MSCHAP-V2` as normal`MSCHAPv2`.



virtual_server::

The inner tunneled request can be sent through a virtual
server constructed specifically for this purpose.

If this entry is commented out, the inner tunneled request
will be sent through the virtual server that processed the
outer requests.



soh::

This option enables support for `MS-SoH` see `doc/SoH.txt` for
more info. It is disabled by default.



soh_virtual_server::

The `SoH` reply will be turned into a request which can be sent
to a specific virtual server:



require_client_cert::

Unlike `EAP-TLS`, `PEAP `does not require a client certificate.
However, you can require one by setting the following
option. You can also override this option by setting

EAP-TLS-Require-Client-Cert = Yes

in the `control` items for a request.

NOTE: The majority of supplicants do not support using a
client certificate with `PEAP`, so this option is unlikely to
be usable for most people.



### EAP MS-CHAPv2

This takes no configuration.

NOTE: It is the EAP MS-CHAPv2 sub-module, not the main `mschap`
module.

Note also that in order for this sub-module to work, the main
`mschap` module MUST ALSO be configured.

This module is the *Microsoft* implementation of `MS-CHAPv2` in `EAP`.
There is another (*incompatible*) implementation of `MS-CHAPv2 in `EAP` by
Cisco, which *FreeRADIUS does not currently support*.


auth_type::

The plain-text response which comes back is put into a
`link:https://freeradius.org/rfc/rfc2865.html#User-Password[User-Password]` attribute, and passed to another module for
authentication.



send_error::

Prior to version 2.1.11, the module never sent the
`link:https://freeradius.org/rfc/rfc2548.html#MS-CHAP-Error[MS-CHAP-Error]` message to the client.  This worked, but it had
issues when the cached password was wrong.  The server
  *should* send `E=691 R=0` to the client, which tells it to
prompt the user for a new password.

CAUTION: The default is to behave as in `2.1.10` and earlier, which is
known to work.  If you set `send_error = yes`, then the error
message will be sent back to the client. This *may* help some
clients work better, but *may* also cause other clients to
stop working.



identity::

Server identifier to send back in the challenge. This should
generally be the host name of the RADIUS server.  Or, some
information to uniquely identify it.



with_ntdomain_hack:: Windows clients send `link:https://freeradius.org/rfc/rfc2865.html#User-Name[User-Name]` in the form of "DOMAIN\User",
but send the challenge/response based only on the User portion.

Default is `no`.



### EAP-FAST

The FAST module implements the EAP-FAST protocol.

NOTE: To use `EAP-FAST` you must also configure an `inner` method in
`mods-enabled/eap_inner`.


tls::

Point to the common TLS configuration.



cipher_list::

If `cipher_list` is set here, it will override the
`cipher_list` configuration from the `tls-common`
configuration.  The `EAP-FAST` module has its own
override for `cipher_list` because the
specifications mandata a different set of ciphers
than are used by the other `EAP` methods.

`cipher_list` though must include "ADH" for anonymous provisioning.
This is not as straightforward as appending "ADH" alongside
"DEFAULT" as "DEFAULT" contains "!aNULL" so instead it is
recommended "ALL:!EXPORT:!eNULL:!SSLv2" is used

NOTE: for OpenSSL 1.1.0 and above you may need to add ":@SECLEVEL=0"



pac_lifetime:: PAC lifetime in seconds.

Default is: `seven days`



authority_identity:: Authority ID of the server.

if you are running a cluster of RADIUS servers, you should make
the value chosen here (and for `pac_opaque_key`) the same on all
your RADIUS servers.  This value should be unique to your
installation.  We suggest using a domain name.



pac_opaque_key::

PAC Opaque encryption key (must be exactly 32 bytes in size).

This value MUST be secret, and MUST be generated using
a secure method, such as via `openssl rand -hex 32`



virtual_server:: Same as for `TTLS`, `PEAP`, etc.



default_provisioning_eap_type:: Default provisioning EAP type.

Default is `mschapv2`



### EAP-SIM

Triplets can be provided using control attributes:

  * `&control.EAP-SIM-KC`
  * `&control.EAP-SIM-RAND`
  * `&control.EAP-SIM-SRES`

NOTE: Three instances of each attribute must be provided.

Alternatively triplets can be generated locally using
control attributes:

  * `&control.SIM-Ki`
  * `&control.SIM-OPc`
  * `&control.SIM-Algo-Version` (optional - see defaults below)

UMTS Milenage inputs (AMF, SQN) are ignored.

`&control.SIM-Algo-Version` selects the SIM algorithm used,
it must match the algorithm used by the SIM.

Accepted values for `SIM-Algo-Version` are:

  * `Comp128v1`
  * `Comp128v2`
  * `Comp128v3` (default if no &control.SIM-OPc)
  * `Comp128v4` (default if &control.SIM-OPc is available)

NOTE: In general operators will not provide the Ki (subscriber
key) for their `SIM cards`, as the Ki is considered highly
sensitive.

Local triplet generation is intended for testing and
research purposes where programmable or virtual SIM cards
are in use.


virtual_server:: EAP-SIM virtual server containing policy
sections.  This must be set, EAP-SIM will not function
without it, as certain operations like vector gathering
require user configuration.



### EAP-AKA


prefer_aka_prime:: Send the AT_BIDDING attribute in
AKA-Challenge messages.

When AT_BIDDING is sent in a AKA-Challenge and the supplicant
supports EAP-AKA-Prime, https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5448[RFC 5448] states the supplicant
should abort the authentication attempt as a bidding down
attack may have occurred.

If a value is not provided for this configuration item
it will be determined automatically by whether the
EAP-AKA-Prime EAP method is enabled.



virtual_server:: EAP-AKA virtual server containing policy
sections.  This must be set, EAP-AKA will not function
without it, as certain operations like vector gathering
require user configuration.



### EAP-AKA-Prime


virtual_server:: EAP-AKA virtual server containing policy
sections.  This must be set, EAP-AKA-Prime will not function
without it, as certain operations like vector gathering
require user configuration.



## Expansions

The rlm_eap module provides the below functions to interact with the `3GPP` and `SIM` protocols.

= EAP Module

The `eap` module takes care of all EAP authentication as described in https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3579[RFC 3579].

[WARNING]
====
Whatever you do, do NOT set 'Auth-Type := EAP'.  The server is smart enough
to figure this out on its own.

The most common side effect of setting 'Auth-Type := EAP' is that the users
then cannot use ANY other authentication method.
====



## Configuration Settings


require_identity_realm:: Require the the EAP Identity provided contains
a realm.

If `require_identity_realm` is `nai`, the EAP identity provided must
end with `@<label0>.<label1>[.<labelN>]`, i.e. an '@' followed by at least
two DNS labels.

If `require_identity_realm` is `yes`, the EAP identity provided must
either match the NAI format described above, or a `Stripped-User-Domain`
attribute must be present in the request list.
This validation mode is intended to be user where Windows machine
authentication is intermixed with user authentication.

If `require_identity_realm` is `no`, no identity format checks are performed.
It is NOT recommended to use this value.  Future security standards will
key off the NAI realm to validate the certificate we (the EAP server) present.
If you do not require an NAI realm be present in the EAP identity string,
your users will not be able to take advantage of this added security when
it is enabled by OS and device vendors.



default_eap_type:: The default EAP submodule to invoke when an `EAP-Identity`
response is received.

If a `default_eap_type` value is not provided, enabled EAP submodules will be
queried to determine if they recognise the provided EAP-Identity.
If no submodules recognise the identity, the first `type` value listed below
will be used.

If the `control.EAP-Type` attribute is set, then that EAP type takes precedence
over any configured or inferred EAP-Type.

It is generally recommended to NOT set `default_eap_type`, and instead order
the `type` configuration items appropriately.



ignore_unknown_eap_types::

There are many EAP types, but the server has support for only a
limited subset.  If the server receives a request for an EAP type it
does not support, then it normally rejects the request.  By setting
this configuration to `yes`, you can tell the server to instead keep
processing the request.  Another module MUST then be configured to
proxy the request to another RADIUS server which supports that EAP
type.

NOTE: If another module is NOT configured to handle the request, then the
request will still end up being rejected.

NOTE: There can only be one instance of the EAP module.

## Allowed EAP-types

type:: Only EAP types listed below with a `type = <EAP-Type>` pair will be allowed.



### EAP-MD5

WARNING: EAP-MD5 authentication cannot be used for wireless
connections.  It is insecure, and does not provide for dynamic WEP
keys or WPA enterprise.




### EAP-PWD (Secure password-based authentication)

In v4, the "known good" password is taken from the `&request.control.Password.Cleartext` list,
as is done by other modules. The change from v3 is that the `inner-tunnel` virtual server
is no not used.




fragment_size:: This has the same meaning as for TLS.



### Generic Token Card

Currently, this is only permitted inside of `EAP-TTLS`, or `EAP-PEAP`.
The module `challenges` the user with text, and the response from the
user is taken to be the `link:https://freeradius.org/rfc/rfc2865.html#User-Password[User-Password]`.

WARNING: Proxying the tunneled `EAP-GTC` session is a bad idea, the users
password will go over the wire in plain-text, for anyone to see.


challenge:: The default challenge, which many clients ignore.



auth_type::

The plain-text response which comes back is put into a
`link:https://freeradius.org/rfc/rfc2865.html#User-Password[User-Password]` attribute, and passed to another module for
authentication.  This allows the `EAP-GTC` response to be
checked against plain-text, or crypt'd passwords.

If you say "Local" instead of "PAP", then the module will
look for a `link:https://freeradius.org/rfc/rfc2865.html#User-Password[User-Password]` configured for the request, and do
the authentication itself.



## Common TLS configuration for TLS-based EAP types

See `doc/raddb/certs/index.adoc` for additional comments on certificates.

If OpenSSL was not found at the time the server was built, the `tls`,
`ttls`, and `peap` sections will be ignored.

If you do not currently have certificates signed by a trusted CA you
may use the 'snakeoil' certificates. Included with the server in
`raddb/certs`.

If these certificates have not been auto-generated:

  cd raddb/certs
  make

These test certificates *SHOULD NOT* be used in a normal
deployment.  They are created only to make it easier to
install the server, and to perform some simple tests with
EAP-TLS, TTLS, or PEAP.

Note that you should NOT use a globally known CA here!
e.g. using a Verisign cert as a "known CA" means that
ANYONE who has a certificate signed by them may be able to
authenticate via EAP-TLS!  This is likely not what you
want.


[NOTE]
====
As of 4.0 the following TLS config items/config sections have been
removed.  Equivalent functionality is available.
====

[options="header,autowidth"]
|===
| Config item | Replacement

| `verify_client_cert_cmd`
| Unlang policy in the `verify certificate { ... }` section of the specified `virtual_server`.

| `check_cert_issuer`
| Unlang policy in the `verify certificate { ... }` section of the specified `virtual_server`.

| `check_cert_cn`
| Unlang policy in the `verify certificate { ... }` section of the specified `virtual_server`.

| `ocsp`
| rlm_ocsp call in the `verify certificate { ... }` section of the specified `virtual_server`.

| `staple`
| rlm_ocsp call in the `staple certificate { ... }` section of the specified `virtual_server`.
|===


virtual_server:: The virtual server used for checking and saving TLS data.

When the module receives certificate checks and stateful
session resumption requests, that information will be passed
through a virtual server.  This virtual server typically runs
policies which verifies the certificate, or loads / stores
session resumption data.

The virtual server must specify `namespace = tls`, and may contain
the following sections:

[options="header,autowidth"]
|===
| Section | Purpose

| `load session { ... }`
| Load stateful session information from a cache.

| `store session { ... }`
| Store stateful session information in a cache.

| `clear session { ... }`
| Clear stateful session information from a cache.

| `verify certificate { ... }` |
| Apply policies based on the client certificate presented.

| `staple certificate { ... }`
| Gather stapling information for one or more of our certificates.
|===

More information about the various sections can be found in the virtual server
link:../../../../../../sites-available/tls.adoc[sites-available/tls].


auto_chain::

OpenSSL will automatically create certificate chains, unless
we tell it to not do that.  The problem is that it sometimes
gets the chains right from a certificate signature view, but
wrong from the clients view.

NOTE: When setting `auto_chain = no`, the server `chain {}`
section(s) below MUST include the full certificate chain.



.A chain of certificates to present to the client

Multiple chain sections can be specified to allow different
chains for different key types (RSA, DSA, DH, EC).

If multiple chains for the same key type are specified
the last chain to be processed will be used for that
key type.

WARNING: The server automatically selects a chain based on
the cipher agreed by the client and server. For example, if
the client includes ECC ciphers in its request, but the
server only has an RSA certificate, then the authentication
is likely to fail.  i.e. The client is asking the server to
use an ECC cipher and ECC certificate, but the server has no
ECC certificate available.

The key type does not need to be explicitly specified as
it is determined from the provided certificate.


format:: The format of the certificate(s) and private key file.

May be one of `PEM`, `DER` or `ASN1` (ASN1 is an alias for `DER`).

Most Linux systems use PEM format.  Windows and other
systems usually use DER.



certificate_file:: File which contains the certificate presented
as the "server certificate" to the client.

If the PEM format is used, the `certificate_file`
should contain the server certificates, along with
any intermediate CAs up to the root CA.  The client
is not normally configured with the intermediate CAs,
but it needs them to verify the server certificate.
The server therefore has to supply the intermediate
CAs to the client during the authentication process.

[NOTE]
====
If `verify_mode` (below) is set to `hard` or `soft`
all intermediary CAs and the Root CA need to be
included in the `certificate_file`.

If the file includes multiple certificates, they MUST
be listedin order from server certificate (first in
the file) to intermediary CAs (second) to Root CA
(last in the file) as per https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4346#section-7.4.2[RFC 4346 Section 7.4.2] (see
certificate_list)

If the DER format is used, the `certificate_file`
should contain ONLY the server's certificate.  One
or more `ca_file` items should be used to load
the intermediate CAs and the Root CA.
====

We recommend using `ca_file` to load the
root CAs, instead of putting them in the
`certificate_file`.



ca_file::  File which contains the root CA.

THis configuration item allows the server to load
additional intermediate CA or Root CA when creating
certificate chains.  Multiple "ca_file"
configurations items may be specified in order to
load multiple certificates.

When multiple `ca_file` entries are used, the server
will still present only one server certificate (from
`certificate_file`) to the clients.  The main use for
multiple `ca_file` entries is to permit the use of
EAP-TLS with client certificates from multiple Root
CAs.

If the root CA does not issue client certificates, or
if only one root CA is , then the `ca_file`
configuration can be commented out (at least when PEM
format is used).



private_key_password:: The password which is used to encrypt the private key.

If the private key is not encrypted, this configuration item
will have no effect.

In general, there is little security benefit in
encrypting the `private_key_file` with a password.



private_key_file:: File which contains the private key.

If the Private key & Certificate are located in the same file,
then `private_key_file` & `certificate_file` must contain the
same file name.



verify_mode:: How we verify the certificate chain.

During startup the server attempts to precompile the certificate chain
from server certificate to Root CA.  This configuration item specifies
what happens if compilation fails.

[options="header,autowidth"]
|===
| Error | Description
| hard  | Error out if we cannot build a complete certificate chain.
| soft  | Warn if we cannot build a complete certificate chain.
| none  | Stay silent if we cannot build a complete certificate chain.
|===

The default is `hard`.  The only time this should be changed is if
you want to limit the number of intermediary CAs sent to the
client by not including them in the chain.

[NOTE]
====
  * Depending on the value of `auto_chain` we may still be able to
  build a complete chain, but this will be done at runtime.

  * `auto_chain` has no effect on which certificates are considered
for pre-compilation.  Only those listed in this `chain {}` section
will be used.
====



include_root_ca:: Whether or not the root CA is included in the
certificate chain.

The Root CA should already be known/trusted by the client so it is
usually not needed unless the client is particularly poorly behaved.

NOTE: The Root CA must still be available for creating certificate chains to
succeed even if `include_root_ca = no`.

Default: `no`.



### ECC certificate chain for key agility

This is disabled by default, see the warning above.

If your supplicants propose a mix of different
types of ciphers _and_ have all of the CA keys for
each type of certificate, then multiple chains can be
enabled simultaneously.



## Server certificate

The server certificate may also be specified at
runtime on a per session basis.  In that use-case,
the certificate file must consist of the
certificate and private key, PEM encoded.  The
password should either be set above with
`password`, or the certificate should have no
password.

The file should be provided as the attribute:

    &control.TLS-Session-Cert-File

If there are any errors loading or verifying the
certificate, then authentication will fail.

This configuration can be used to periodically
verify correct supplicant behaviour, by presenting
an untrusted or invalid server certificate and
verifying that the supplicant returns the correct
TLS alert (available in Module-Failure-Message).

NOTE: After receiving a fatal alert, TLS negotiation
cannot continue, but as most supplicants will retry
enthusiastically, so this probably won't be an issue.



ca_file:: Trusted Root CA list

ALL of the CA's in this list will be trusted to issue client
certificates for authentication.

NOTE: You should not use a public CA here.  This should either be
set to a certificate chain for your institution's CA,
or to a self signed Root CA.



psk_identity:: Default identity to present for PSK.

If OpenSSL supports TLS-PSK, then we can use a PSK identity
and (hex) password.

If using a fixed identity, it must be the same on
the client.  The passphrase must be a hex value,
and can be up to 256 hex characters.



WARNING: Dynamic queries for the `PSK`.  If `TLS-PSK` is used,
and `psk_query` is set, then you MUST NOT use
`psk_identity` or `psk_hexphrase`.



psk_query:: Dynamically obtain the PSK from a query.

Instead, use a dynamic expansion similar to the one
below.  It keys off of TLS-PSK-Identity.  It should
return a of string no more than 512 hex characters.
That string will be converted to binary, and will
be used as the dynamic PSK hexphrase.

Note that this query is just an example.  You will
need to customize it for your installation.



For DH cipher suites to work, you have to run OpenSSL to
create the DH file first:

	openssl dhparam -out certs/dh 2048

The DH parameters will usually be ignored in FIPS mode.



fragment_size:: Limit for size of EAP fragments.

This can never exceed the size of a RADIUS packet (4096
bytes), and is preferably less than half of that, to leave
room for other attributes in RADIUS packet.  In most cases,
the maximum EAP packet length is limited to the Ethernet MTU,
which between `1500 - 1600` bytes.

In these cases, fragment size should be `1024` or less.  Note
also that the EAP RFCs say that EAP implementations MUST use
fragments of at least 1020 bytes!  Many implementations will
work with smaller values, but it is not guaranteed.



ca_path:: Directory where additional CAs are located.

After placing files in this directory, the OpenSSL command
`c_rehash` should be used to update the local files used by OpenSSL.

Most systems will only use one server certificate,
and one root CA.  Where client certificates are
used, they are usually also issued from that same
root CA.  In which case the `ca_path` configuration
is not necessary.  All certificates can be placed
into the file which is configured in `certificate_file`.

The main reason to use multiple `ca_file` entries,
or the `ca_path` configuration, is when the server
is expected to authenticate client certificates issued by multiple CAs.



cipher_list:: Set the list of allowed TLS cipher suites.

The format is listed by OpenSSL in `man 1 ciphers`.

NOTE: For `EAP-FAST`, use "ALL:!EXPORT:!eNULL:!SSLv2"



cipher_server_preference:: Prefer the server cipher list.

If enabled, OpenSSL will use the server cipher list (possibly
defined by the `cipher_list` option above) for choosing right
cipher suite, instead of using the client-specified list which is
OpenSSl default behavior. Having it set to 'yes' is best
practice for TLS.



tls_max_version:: Maximum TLS version we allow.

[NOTE]
====
  * Work-arounds for OpenSSL nonsense.  OpenSSL 1.0.1f and 1.0.1g do
not calculate the `EAP` keys correctly.  The fix is to upgrade
OpenSSL, or to disable TLS 1.2 here.

  * SSLv2 and SSLv3 are permanently disabled due to security
issues.

  * We STRONGLY RECOMMEND that TLS 1.0 and TLS 1.1 be disabled.
They are insecure and SHOULD NOT BE USED.
====



tls_min_version:: Minimum TLS version we allow.

[NOTE]
====
Prevents versions < tls_min_version from being negotiated.
In general the higher the tls_min_version the more secure
the protocol, but the narrower the range of supported TLS
clients.

SSLv2 and SSLv3 are permanently disabled due to security
issues.
====



ecdh_curve:: Elliptical cryptography configuration.

Should be a colon-separated list of curve names.

For supported curve names, please run the command:

openssl ecparam -list_curves



verify:: Parameters for controlling client cert chain
verification.

Certificate verification is performed in two phases.
The first is handled by the SSL library which checks
whether a trusted chain of certificates can be built
between the certificates loaded from `ca_file` or
found in `ca_path`.

The second (optional) phase is performed using the
`verify * { ... }` sections of the tls
`virtual_server`.


mode:: Which certificates in the verification chain
should be checked.

Certificate verification is performed in two phases.
The first is handled by the SSL library which checks
whether a trusted chain of certificates can be built
between the certificates loaded from `ca_file` or
found in `ca_path`.

The SSL library also checks that the the correct usage
OIDs are present in the presented client certificate
and that none of the certificates have expired.

[options="header,autowidth"]
|===
| Value | Description

| `disabled`
| Don't verify any certificates.

| `all`
| Verify all certificates.  Check none have been
  revoked via CRL, and that all are trusted.

| `untrusted`
| Verify all untrusted certificates,
  i.e. those which were presented by the client
  and not loaded on startup.

| `client-and-issuer`
| Verify the client certificate and its issuer.

| `client`
| Only verify the client certificate.
|===

It is recommended to leave mode as `all` except
when debugging, or in an emergency situation.



attribute_mode:: Which client certificates should
be converted to attributes for use in the
`verify * { ... }` sections of the specified
`virtual_server`.

Attributes created during certificate processing
will be placed in the `&session-state` list.
This is to simplify session-resumption, as the
contents of this list also contains session data
for stateful resumption, and this list is encoded
in the session-ticket for stateless resumption.

[options="header,autowidth"]
|===
| Value | Description

| `disabled`
| Don't produce any attributes.

| `all`
| Create attributes for all certificates from
  the root, to the presented client certificate.

| `untrusted`
| Create attributes for untrusted certificates,
  i.e. those which were presented by the client
  and not loaded on startup.

| `client-and-issuer`
| Create attributes for the client certificate
  and its issuer.

| `client`
| Only create attributes for the client
  certificate.
|===

[NOTE]
====
Attribute generation is only performed on full
handshake, or where we detect that attributes
are missing from the &session-state list during
stateful session-resumption.

Certificate attributes will usually be retrieved
from the the session-ticket in the case of
stateless session-resumption.
====



check_crl:: Check the Certificate Revocation List.

Will check CRLs for all certificates in the certificate chain.

1. Copy CA certificates and CRLs to same directory.
2. Execute `c_rehash <CA certs&CRLs Directory>`. `c_rehash` is
   OpenSSL's command.
3. uncomment the lines below.
4. Restart radiusd.



allow_expired_crl:: Accept an expired Certificate Revocation List.



allow_not_yet_valid_crl:: Accept a not-yet-valid Certificate Revocation List.


### TLS Session resumption

Once authentication has completed, the TLS client may be
provided with a session ticket which it presents
during the next authentication attempt.

Presenting a session ticket allows the client to skip the
majority of TLS tunnel setup during its next authentication
session.  It also means that any "inner" authentication is
skipped, which means that any "inner" policies need to be
cached.

Enabling `Session-Resumption` is highly recommended for sites
using slow authentication backends such as winbindd/Active
Directory, and for access federations operating over the
internet, such as Eduroam.

For EAP-TLS, the server also caches the client certificate,
as it is not supplied during session resumption.  Caching the
client certificate allows the server to re-apply policy rules
for the client certificate, along with certificate expiry time.

Many of the configuration items in this section increase
security, but are disabled by default.  The intent is to
allow the server to work in the widest possible
circumstances, while still being reasonably secure.  In the
most common case (single EAP module, single server
certificate), this configuratiuon is acceptable.

However, we still recommend enabling all of the security
configurations below.  If enabling them does not cause an
issue in your environment, then there is no cost to leaving
them enabled.  They should only be disabled if clients are
unable to connect when the configurations are enabled.

[NOTE]
====
You must ensure that any attributes required for policy
decisions are cached along with the TLS session
data. This is usually done by placing policy attributes in the
`&session-state` list, or in the case of EAP-PEAP, EAP-TTLS and
EAP-FAST, the `&parent.session-state` list (i.e. in the request
which sets up the TLS part of the authentication attempt).

Caching this data means that the policies are cached at the
same time as, and along with the session resumption data.  In
most cases, it is sufficient to cache the name of a policy,
so that the named policy can be re-applied on session resumption.
====


mode:: What type of session caching should be allowed.

[options="header,autowidth"]
|===
| Value | Description

| `disabled`
| Don't allow any kind of session resumption.

| `stateful`
| Use <= TLS 1.2 style stateful session resumption.
  A unique session-identifier is provided to the client.
  The client provides this identifier during the next
  authentication attempt, and we lookup session information
  based on this identifier.
  A `virtual_server` with `load session { ... }`,
  `store session { ... }` and `clear session { ... }`
  sections must be configured.

| `stateless`
| Allow session-ticket based resumption.  This requires no
  external support.  All information required for resumption
  is sent to the TLS client in an encrypted session-ticket.
  The client returns this ticket during the next
  authentication attempt.

| `auto`
| Choose an appropriate session resumption type based on
  the TLS version used and whether a `virtual_server` is
  configured and has the required `session` sections.
|===

It is recommended to set `mode = auto` *and* to provide a
correctly configured `virtual_server`.

Some clients such as wpa_supplicant do not allow
session tickets by default for TLS < 1.3.


name:: Name of the context used for TLS sessions.

This name associates the TLS sessions with a
"namespace" so that they cannot be used for purposes
other than the original (intended) use-case.  This
configuration helps to prevent accidental "leakage"
of session tickes.  For example, if the server uses
multiple server certs, an attacker could try to get a
session ticket for one server identity, and then
resume the session for a different server identity.
Using a session ticket "namespace" makes these
attacks impossible.

If you wish to share session resumption data between
multiple EAP modules or virtual servers, they must
all use the same `name`.

To disable - set to a zero length string "".

NOTE: OpenSSL only allows 32 bytes of session ctx, so
the value provided here is first hashed with SHA256
before being passed to OpenSSL.



lifetime:: The period for which a resumable session remains vali.d

Default is 24hrs in line with https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4346[RFC 4346].  https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8446[RFC 8446]
requires that ticket lifetimes must not be more than
7 days.



require_extended_master_secret:: Only allow session
resumption if an extended master secret has been
created.  This requires client support.

Extended Master Secrets (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7627[RFC 7627]) are required to
prevent MITM attacks, where the attacker can resume
a session if it can insert itself into the path between
the TLS client and TLS server.

See more at https://mitls.org/pages/attacks/3SHAKE

WARNING: This attack is undetectable by the client.



require_perfect_forward_secrecy:: Only allow session
resumption if a cipher which would allow perfect
forward secrecy has been selected.



session_ticket_key:: Key used to encrypt stateless
session tickets.

Sets a persistent key used to encrypt stateless session
tickets.  If this is not set, then a random key will be
chosen when the server starts.

Where a site has multiple RADIUS servers, it is
useful for them to share a common value for the
`session_ticket_key`.  That way a client can
authenticate against one server, get a session
ticket, and then have that session ticket validated
by a different server.  Such a configuration has
significant positive effects for increasing uptime,
and decreasing server load.

As the key length used by OpenSSL depends on the
version/flavour of OpenSSL being used, the value
provided is fed into a HKDF function (SHA256 of the
key plus "freeradius-session-ticket").  The output of
the HKDF is then used as input to the OpenSSL keying
function.

It is important that a strong key is chosen here.  If the
key were ever revealed, then an attacker could manipulate
the contents of a session ticket.  This could in turn
allow privilege escalation, or if OpenSSL's ticket parsing
code is less than perfect, buffer overflow attacks.



[NOTE]
====
As of 4.0 OpenSSL's internal cache has been disabled due to
scoping/threading issues.

The following configuration options are no longer
supported.  TLS session caching is now handled by
FreeRADIUS either using session-tickets (stateless),
or using TLS `virtual_server` and storing/retrieving
sessions to/from an external datastore (stateful).

  * `enable`
  * `persist_dir`
  * `max_entries`
====



### EAP-TLS

The common TLS configuration for TLS-based EAP types is given above
in the `tls-config { ... }` section.

Point to the common TLS configuration


require_client_cert:: Whether we require a client certificate.

`EAP-TLS` can work without a client certificate, but situations
whether this is useful are quite limited.

Currently only the Hotspot 2.0 R2 standard uses `EAP-TLS`
without a peer certificate.

This is to secure the SSID used to provide connectivity to the OSU
(Online Signup Server).

You can override this configuration item at run-time by setting:

  &control.EAP-TLS-Require-Client-Cert = Yes/No



include_length:: Whether we include a length field in the TLS header.

If set to `yes`, the total length of the message is included
in every packet we send. If set to `no`, the total length of
the message is included only in the First packet of a
fragment series.

This configuration item is here only to work around
historical issues with misbehaving clients.  In most cases,
it does not need to be changed.



### EAP-TTLS

The TTLS module implements the `EAP-TTLS` protocol, which can be
described as EAP inside of Diameter, inside of TLS, inside of EAP,
inside of RADIUS.

NOTE: To use `EAP-TTLS `you must also configure an `inner` method in
`mods-enabled/eap_inner`.

Surprisingly, it works quite well.

When using `PAP`, `GTC`, or `MSCAHPv2` as an inner method, `EAP-TTLS`
is only secure if the supplicant validates the server certificate
presented.  If the client disables certificate validation, then an
attacker can pretend to be the server, and collect user credentials.


tls::  Point to the common TLS configuration

Which `tls-config` section the TLS negotiation parameters
are in - see `EAP-TLS` above for an explanation.



[WARNING]
====
Both `copy_request_to_tunnel` and `use_tunneled_reply` have been
removed in v4.0.

See the new policy `copy_request_to_tunnel` in
link:../../../../../../sites-available/inner-tunnel.adoc[sites-available/inner-tunnel], and in `policy.d/eap` for
more information.  ====



virtual_server:: The virtual server used for "inner" authentication.

The inner tunneled request can be sent through a virtual
server which verifies the inner credentials.

If this entry is commented out, the inner tunneled request
will be sent through the virtual server which processed the
outer request.  This configuration is NOT RECOMMENDED.



include_length:: Whether we include a length field in the TLS header.

This has the same meaning, and overwrites, the same field in
the `tls` configuration, above.  The default value here is
`yes`.



require_client_cert:: Whether we require a client certificate.

`EAP-TTLS` does not require a client certificate.
However, you can require one by setting the
following option. You can also override this option by
setting:

  &control.EAP-TLS-Require-Client-Cert = Yes

NOTE: The majority of supplicants do not support using a
client certificate with `EAP-TTLS`, so this option is unlikely
to be useful for most people.



### EAP-PEAP

The tunneled `EAP` session needs a default `EAP` type which is separate
from the one for the non-tunneled EAP module.  Inside of the TLS/PEAP
tunnel, we recommend using `EAP-MS-CHAPv2`.

When using `GTC`, or `MSCHAPv2` as an inner method, `PEAP` is only
secure if the supplicant is configured to validate the server
certificate.  See the comments above for EAP-TTLS about this topic.

#### Windows compatibility

[IMPORTANT]
====
  * If you see the server send an `link:https://freeradius.org/rfc/rfc2865.html#Access-Challenge[Access-Challenge]`, and the client never
sends another `link:https://freeradius.org/rfc/rfc2865.html#Access-Request[Access-Request]`, then	*STOP*!

  * The server certificate has to have special OID's in it, or else the
Microsoft clients will silently fail.  See the `scripts/xpextensions`
file for details, and the following page
http://support.microsoft.com/kb/814394/en-us

  * If is still doesn't work, and you're using Samba, you may be
encountering a Samba bug.

  * Note that we do not necessarily agree with their explanation. but
the fix does appear to work.

NOTE: To use `PEAP` you must also configure an inner method in
`mods-enabled/eap_inner`.


tls::  Point to the common TLS configuration

Which `tls-config` section the TLS negotiation parameters are
in - see `EAP-TLS` above for an explanation.



default_eap_type:: The default EAP type proposed by the server inside of the tunnel.

The tunneled EAP session needs a default EAP type which is
separate from the one for the non-tunneled EAP module.
Inside of the PEAP tunnel, we recommend using MS-CHAPv2, as
that is the default type supported by Windows clients.



[NOTE]
====
Both `copy_request_to_tunnel` and `use_tunneled_reply` have been
removed in v4.0.

See the new policy `copy_request_to_tunnel` in
link:../../../../../../sites-available/inner-tunnel.adoc[sites-available/inner-tunnel], and in `policy.d/eap`
for more information.
====



virtual_server:: The virtual server used for "inner" authentication.

The inner tunneled request can be sent through a virtual
server which verifies the inner credentials.

If this entry is commented out, the inner tunneled request
will be sent through the virtual server which processed the
outer request.  This configuration is NOT RECOMMENDED.



require_client_cert:: Whether we require a client certificate.

Unlike `EAP-TLS`, `PEAP `does not require a client certificate.
However, you can require one by setting the following
option. You can also override this option by setting

&control.EAP-TLS-Require-Client-Cert = Yes

NOTE: The majority of supplicants do not support using a
client certificate with `PEAP`, so this option is unlikely to
be useful for most people.



### EAP MS-CHAPv2

NOTE: This is the EAP MS-CHAPv2 sub-module, not the main `mschap`
module.

In order for this sub-module to work, the main `mschap` module MUST
ALSO be configured.

This module is the *Microsoft* implementation of `MS-CHAPv2` in `EAP`.
There is another (*incompatible*) implementation of `MS-CHAPv2 in `EAP` by
Cisco, which *FreeRADIUS does not support*.


auth_type:: Which "authenticate" section is used to authenticate the MS-CHAP data.



send_error:: Whether we send an MS-CHAP error on authentication failure.

In early versions of FreeRADIUS, the module never sent the
`link:https://freeradius.org/rfc/rfc2548.html#MS-CHAP-Error[MS-CHAP-Error]` message to the client.  This worked, but it had
issues when the cached password was wrong.  The server
  *should* send `E=691 R=0` to the client, which tells it to
prompt the user for a new password.

CAUTION: The default is `no`, which is known to work.  If you
set `send_error = yes`, then the error message will be sent
back to the client. This *may* help some clients work better,
but *may* also cause other clients to stop working.



identity:: The server identifier to send back in the challenge.

It should generally be the host name of the RADIUS server.
Or, some information which uniquely identifies it.



with_ntdomain_hack:: Windows clients send `link:https://freeradius.org/rfc/rfc2865.html#User-Name[User-Name]` in the
form of `DOMAIN\User`, but sometimes calculate the
challenge/response based only on the `User` portion.

Setting this value to `yes` makes FreeRADIUS use only the
"user" portion of the `link:https://freeradius.org/rfc/rfc2865.html#User-Name[User-Name]` for its MS-CHAP
calculations.

If this behavior seems weird and complicated, we agree.
There is no reason for the Windows systems to do something so
unfriendly.  All it does is make life difficult for the
administrator, who has to figure out why MS-CHAP is magically
failing.

Default is `no`.



### EAP-FAST

The FAST module implements the EAP-FAST protocol.

NOTE: To use `EAP-FAST` you must also configure an `inner` method in
`mods-enabled/eap_inner`.


tls::  Point to the common TLS configuration



cipher_list:: Set the list of allowed TLS cipher suites.

If `cipher_list` is set here, it will override the
`cipher_list` configuration from the `tls-common`
configuration.  The `EAP-FAST` module has its own override
for `cipher_list` because the specifications mandate a
different set of ciphers than are used by the other `EAP`
methods.

The `cipher_list` MUST include "ADH" for anonymous
provisioning.  This is not as straightforward as appending
"ADH" alongside "DEFAULT" as "DEFAULT" contains "!aNULL" so
instead it is recommended "ALL:!EXPORT:!eNULL:!SSLv2" is used

NOTE: for OpenSSL 1.1.0 and above you may need to add ":@SECLEVEL=0"



pac_lifetime:: PAC lifetime in seconds.

Default is: `seven days`



authority_identity:: Authority ID of the server.

if you are running a cluster of RADIUS servers, you should make
the value chosen here (and for `pac_opaque_key`) the same on all
your RADIUS servers.  This value should be unique to your
installation.  We suggest using a domain name.



pac_opaque_key:: Key sued to encrypt the PAC.

The PAC key must be exactly 32 bytes in size.

This value MUST be secret, and MUST be generated using
a secure method, such as via `openssl rand -hex 32`



virtual_server:: The virtual server used for "inner" authentication.



default_provisioning_eap_type:: Default provisioning EAP type.

Default is `mschapv2`



### EAP-SIM


virtual_server:: The EAP-SIM virtual server containing policy
sections.

This configuration must be set, EAP-SIM will not function
without it, as certain operations such as getting SIM vectors
require configuration for each user.



### EAP-AKA


prefer_aka_prime:: Send the AT_BIDDING attribute in
AKA-Challenge messages.

When AT_BIDDING is sent in a AKA-Challenge and the supplicant
supports EAP-AKA-Prime, https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5448[RFC 5448] states the supplicant
should abort the authentication attempt as a bidding down
attack may have occurred.

If a value is not provided for this configuration item
it will be determined automatically by whether the
EAP-AKA-Prime EAP method is enabled.



virtual_server:: The EAP-SIM virtual server containing policy
sections.

This configuration must be set, EAP-AKA will not function
without it, as certain operations such as getting vectors
require configuration for each user.



### EAP-AKA-Prime


virtual_server:: The EAP-SIM virtual server containing policy
sections.

This configuration must be set, EAP-AKA' will not function
without it, as certain operations such as getting vectors
require configuration for each user.

= Microsoft CHAP authentication Module

The `mschap` module performs `MS-CHAP` and `MS-CHAPv2` authentication.

MS-CHAP authentication requires access to either the
Password.Cleartext or NT-Password attribute for the user.  Due to
the limitations of MS-CHAP, no other password "encryption" methods
are possible.

This module validates a user with `MS-CHAP` or `MS-CHAPv2` authentication.
If called in `recv Access-Request`, it will look for `MS-CHAP` Challenge/Response
attributes in the `request` list and adds an `Auth-Type` attribute set to
`mschap` in the Config-Items list unless Auth-Type has already set.

The module also enforces the `SMB-Account-Ctrl` attribute. See the
Samba documentation for the meaning of SMB account control. The
module does not read Samba password files. Instead, the rlm_passwd
module can be used to read a Samba password file, and then supply
an `NT-Password` attribute which this module can use.

## Configuration Settings

NOTE: If you are using `/etc/smbpasswd`, see the `passwd` module
for an example of how to use `/etc/smbpasswd`


normalise::

By default the server will use heuristics to try and automatically
handle base64 or hex encoded passwords or hashes.
This behaviour can be disabled by setting the following to `no`.

The default is `yes`



use_mppe::

By default the `mschap` will add `link:https://freeradius.org/rfc/rfc2548.html#MS-CHAP-MPPE-Keys[MS-CHAP-MPPE-Keys]` for `MS-CHAPv1` and
`link:https://freeradius.org/rfc/rfc2548.html#MS-MPPE-Recv-Key[MS-MPPE-Recv-Key]` and `link:https://freeradius.org/rfc/rfc2548.html#MS-MPPE-Send-Key[MS-MPPE-Send-Key]` for `MS-CHAPv2`.  Set this
configuration item to `no` in order to not add the MPPE keys.

Default is `yes`.



require_encryption::

if `use_mppe` is enabled, the `require_encryption` makes encryption moderate.

Default is `no`.



require_strong::

It always requires 128 bit key encryption.

Default is `no`.



with_ntdomain_hack:: Windows clients send `link:https://freeradius.org/rfc/rfc2865.html#User-Name[User-Name]` in the form of "DOMAIN\User",
but send the challenge/response based only on the User portion.

Default is `yes`.



ntlm_auth:: Path and arguments to the `ntlm_auth` program.

The module can perform authentication itself, OR
use a Windows Domain Controller.  This configuration
directive tells the module to call the `ntlm_auth`
program, which will do the authentication, and return
the `NT-Key`.

NOTE: you MUST have the such services "winbindd" and "nmbd"
running on the local machine for `ntlm_auth` to work.

See the `ntlm_auth` program documentation for details.

If `ntlm_auth` is configured below, then the `mschap` module
will call `ntlm_auth` for every `MS-CHAP` authentication request.

If there is a cleartext or NT hashed password available, you can set
`MS-CHAP-Use-NTLM-Auth := No` in the control items, and the `mschap`
module will do the authentication itself, without calling `ntlm_auth`.

You can also try setting the user name as:

`... --username=%(mschap:User-Name) ...`

In that case, the `mschap` module will look at the `link:https://freeradius.org/rfc/rfc2865.html#User-Name[User-Name]`
attribute, and do prefix/suffix checks in order to obtain the _best_
user name for the request.

Depending on the AD / Samba configuration, you may also need to add:

`--allow-mschapv2`

to the list of command-line options.

WARNING: Be VERY careful when editing the following line!
Change the path, and ideally nothing else.



ntlm_auth_timeout:: Time to wait for `ntlm_auth` to run.

This is a long time, and if `ntlm_auth` is taking that long
then you likely have other problems in your domain.

The length of time can be decreased with the following
option, which can save clients waiting if your `ntlm_auth`
usually finishes quicker.

Range `1` to `10` seconds.

Default is `10` seconds.



winbind { ...}:: Configuration options for talking to Winbind.


username:: User name for winbind
domain:: Domain name for winbind

An alternative to using `ntlm_auth` is to connect to the
winbind daemon directly for authentication. This option
is likely to be faster and may be useful on busy systems.

Performance seems to be about twice that of `ntlm_auth`,
which still isn't a lot.

Using this option requires libwbclient from Samba 4.2.1 or
later to be installed. Make sure that `ntlm_auth` above is
commented out.



retry_with_normalised_username::

When using single sign-on with a winbind connection and the
client uses a different casing for the username than the
casing is according to the backend, reauth may fail because
of some Windows internals.
This switch tries to find the user in the correct casing in
the backend, and retry authentication with that username.



.Pool

TIP: Information for the winbind connection pool.  The
configuration items below are the same for all modules
which use the connection pool.


start::

Connections to create during module instantiation.
If the server cannot create specified number of
connections during instantiation it will exit.
Set to 0 to allow the server to start without the
winbind daemon being available.



min::

Minimum number of connections to keep open.



max:: Maximum number of connections.

If these connections are all in use and a new one
is requested, the request will NOT get a connection.

Setting `max` to LESS than the number of threads means
that some threads may starve, and you will see errors
like 'No connections available and at max connection limit'

Setting `max` to MORE than the number of threads means
that there are more connections than necessary.



spare:: Spare connections to be left idle.

NOTE: Idle connections WILL be closed if `idle_timeout`
is set. This should be less than or equal to `max` above.



uses:: Number of uses before the connection is closed.

0 means "infinite"



retry_delay::

The number of seconds to wait after the server tries
to open a connection, and fails.  During this time,
no new connections will be opened.



lifetime::

The lifetime (in seconds) of the connection.

NOTE: A setting of 0 means infinite (no limit).



cleanup_interval::

The pool is checked for free connections every
`cleanup_interval`.  If there are free connections,
then one of them is closed.



idle_timeout::

The idle timeout (in seconds).  A connection which is
unused for this length of time will be closed.

NOTE: A setting of `0` means infinite (no timeout).



[NOTE]
====
All configuration settings are enforced.  If a
connection is closed because of `idle_timeout`,
`uses`, or `lifetime`, then the total number of
connections MAY fall below `min`.  When that
happens, it will open a new connection.  It will
also log a WARNING message.

The solution is to either lower the `min` connections,
or increase lifetime/idle_timeout.
====



.Pass Change


ntlm_auth:: Path and arguments to ntlm_auth for password change.

ntlm_auth_username:: The user name for ntlm_auth password change.

ntlm_auth_domain:: The domain name for ntlm_auth password change.

This module support `MS-CHAPv2` (not v1) password
change requests.  See `doc/howto/modules/mschap.adoc` for
some IMPORTANT information.

Samba/ntlm_auth - if you are using `ntlm_auth` to validate
passwords, you will need to use `ntlm_auth` to change passwords.

Uncomment the three lines below, and change the path to `ntlm_auth.



local_cpw::

To implement a local password change, you need to supply a string
which is then expanded, so that the password can be placed somewhere.

e.g. passed to a script (`exec`), or written to SQL (UPDATE/INSERT).

TIP: We give both examples here, but *only one should be used*.



use_open_directory::

For Apple Server, when running on the same machine as Open Directory.
It has no effect on other systems.



allow_retry::

On failure, set (or not) the `MS-CHAP` error code saying _retries allowed_.



retry_msg::

An optional retry message.

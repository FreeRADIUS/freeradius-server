= Client Module

The `client` module loads RADIUS clients as needed, rather than when the server
starts.

This module is listed in the `new client { ... }` section of a virtual server to read
client definitions from FreeRADIUS config files transforming them into attributes.
These attributes are then used by the server to create internal client definitions.

This indirection is necessary as client definitions can be provided by many different
modules (`ldap`, `sql`, `couchbase` etc...), all of which emit client data in
attribute form.  Treating static configuration files specially would increase code
complexity.

There are no configuration entries for this module. Instead, it relies on the `client`
configuration.

You must:

1. Link `raddb/sites-enabled/dynamic_clients` to `raddb/sites-available/dynamic_clients`.

2. Define a client network/mask (see the top of `raddb/sites-enabled/dynamic_clients).

3. Uncomment the `directory` entry in that client definition.

4. List `client` in the `new client { .. }` section of the `client` virtual server.
The default example already does this.

5. Put files into the above directory, one per IP.  e.g. file `192.0.2.1` should contain
a normal client definition
for a client with IP address `192.0.2.1`.

NOTE: For more documentation, see the file `raddb/sites-available/dynamic-clients`



## Client Configuration

In addition to loading `client` definitions in from flat files, the clients module can
also be used to access data from previously defined clients.



### Attribute Mapping

Maps arbitrary fields from a client definition to attributes in the current request.

[source,unlang]
---
map client [<ipaddr>] {            // <1>
     &Tmp-String-0 = 'nas_type'    // <2>
     &Tmp-String-1 := 'shortname'  // <3>
     &Tmp-String-3 += 'groups'     // <4>
}
---

<1> By default `map client { ... }` will operate on the current client, but alternative
    clients can by specified by `<ipaddr>`.
<2> Assigns the value of the `nas_type` field from the client definition to
    `&Tmp-String-0` if `&Tmp-String-0` doesn't exist.
<3> Assigns the value of the `shortname` field from the client definition to
    `&Tmp-String-1`.
<4> Creates multiple `&Tmp-String-3` attributes from a custom group field associated
    with the client.


### Access Expansion

[options="header,autowidth"]
|===
| XLAT                          | Description
| `%(client:<field>)`           | Expands to a field in the client definition.
| `%(client:<field> <ipaddr>)`  | Expands to a field in the client definition specified
                                  by `<ipaddr>`.

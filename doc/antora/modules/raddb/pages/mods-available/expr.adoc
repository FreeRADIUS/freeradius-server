= Expr Module

This module performs mathematical calculations:

NOTE: This module is not called directly in any section, it is
invoked through the dynamic expansion of strings.

e.g:

  Attribute-Name = "%{expr:2 + 3 + &NAS-Port}"

It supports the following operators (in order of precedence).

[options="header,autowidth"]
|===
| Operator  | Description
| &         | binary AND
| \|        | binary OR
| <<	       | left shift
| >>        | right shift
| +         | addition
| -         | subtraction
| *         | multiply
| /         | divide
| %%        | remainder
| ^         | exponentiation
| (...)     | sub-expression
|===

Operator precedence follows the normal rules.
Division by zero means that the entire expression is invalid.

All calculations are done on signed 63-bit integers.
e.g. `int64_t`.  This should be sufficient for all normal
purposes.

  * Hex numbers are supported:		0xabcdef
  * It also allows unary negation:	-1
  * And twos complement:		~1
  * Otherwise numbers are decimal.

As with all string expansions, you can nest the expansions:

  %{expr: %{NAS-Port} + 1}
  %{expr: %{sql:SELECT ... } + 1}

Attribute references are supported for integer attributes.
e.g. `&NAS-Port`.  The benefit of using attribute references
is that the expression is calculated directly on the
attribute.

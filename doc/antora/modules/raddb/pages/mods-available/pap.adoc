= PAP Module

**PAP** stands for Password Authentication Protocol.

It is the simplest authentication protocol used by FreeRADIUS, as
it requires only the Username and Password RADIUS
[attributes](attributes) (defined by the original RFCs) to
authenticate users.

By extension, it is also one of the least secure protocols,
because the password is protected **only** by the shared secret,
so anyone who is able to sniff RADIUS UDP datagrams between the
client and the server can pretty easily brute-force break that.

To use PAP with FreeRADIUS, you can match usernames with the
Cleartext-Password attribute in the [users](users) file, but also
using any other authentication back-end such as
rlm\_ldap or rlm\_sql.

The `pap` module accepts a large number of formats for the _known good_ (reference)
password, such as crypt hashes, md5 hashes, and etc.
The module takes the `link:https://freeradius.org/rfc/rfc2865.html#User-Password[User-Password]` and performs the necessary transformations of the
user submitted password to match the copy of the password the server has retrieved.

For instructions on creating the various types of passwords,
see http://www.openldap.org/faq/data/cache/347.html

The module looks for the `Password.With-Header` control attribute to find
the *"known good" password*. The attribute value comprises the header followed
immediately by the password data. The header is given by the following table.

[options="header,autowidth"]
|===
| Header       | Attribute           | Description
| {clear}      | Password.Cleartext  | Clear-text passwords.

|===

The module tries to be flexible when handling the various password for mats.
It will automatically handle Base-64 encoded data, hex strings, and binary data,
and convert them to a format that the server can  use.

If there is no `Password.With-Header` attribute, the module looks for one
of the `Password.Cleartext`, `Password.NT`, `Password.Crypt`, etc. attributes
as listed in the above table. These attributes should contain the relevant
format password directly, without the header prefix.

Only one control attribute should be set, otherwise the behaviour is undefined
as to which one is used for authentication.

NOTE: It is important to understand the difference between the `link:https://freeradius.org/rfc/rfc2865.html#User-Password[User-Password]`
and `Password.Cleartext` attributes. The `Password.Cleartext` attribute is
the  *"known  good"* password for the user. Simply supplying the `Password.Cleartext`
to the server will result in most authentication methods working. The `link:https://freeradius.org/rfc/rfc2865.html#User-Password[User-Password]`
attribute is the password as typed in by the user on their private machine.
The two are not the  same, and should be treated very differently. That is, you should
generally not use the `link:https://freeradius.org/rfc/rfc2865.html#User-Password[User-Password]` attribute anywhere in the RADIUS configuration.

## Configuration Settings


normalise::

By default the server will use heuristics to try and automatically
handle base64 or hex encoded passwords. This behaviour can be
stopped by setting the following to `no`.

The default is `yes`



password_attribute:: Which attribute in the request should be used as
the user's password when performing PAP authentication.


== Default Configuration

```
pap {
#	normalise = no
#	password_attribute = &User-Password
}
```

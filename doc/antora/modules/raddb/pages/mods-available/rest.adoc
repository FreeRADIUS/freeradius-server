= Rest Module

The `rest` module sends HTTP requests to remote servers and decodes
the responses. Can also perform basic auth with user's credentials.

See https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616[RFC 2616] for more details about HTTP.



tls { ... }:: Configure the tls related items that control
how FreeRADIUS connects to a HTTPS server.


.Certificate validation options

Specifies how the certificate(s) presented by the HTTPS server being contacted
are validated, and which certificates (if any) to send to the HTTPS server.



ca_file:: PEM formatted file containing the chain to validate the HTTPS server's cert

Should usually contain a concatenation of one or more intermediary CA
files, shallowest (i.e. the one that signed the HTTPS server's cert) first, and
deepest (the root CA) last.

Providing a complete certificate chain here is the most common way of validating
the certificate presented by a HTTPS server.



ca_issuer_file:: PEM formatted file containing the CA that signed the HTTPS server's cert

Specifies the certificate that directly signed the certificate presented by the
HTTPS server.

This configuration option can be used to prevent certificates passing validation that
were signed by other intermediary CAs or root CAs in the trusted certificate chain.



ca_path:: A directory containing multiple root CA certs named by their hash

See the OpenSSL documentation for more details:
- https://www.openssl.org/docs/man1.1.0/man3/SSL_CTX_set_default_verify_paths.html
- https://www.openssl.org/docs/man1.1.1/man1/c_rehash.html

This configuration option should only be used when the HTTPS server being contacted
is not known ahead of time (using a URL from an external source), and/or the CA used
to sign the HTTPS server certificate is unknown.



certificate_file:: PEM formatted file containing the certificate we present to the HTTPS server

Specifies a certificate and any intermediary CAs we should send to the HTTPS server.

This file should usually contain the client certificate file first, then any
intermediary signing CAs, shallowest (direct signee of the certificate_file)
to deepest (signed directly by the root CA).



private_key_file:: PEM formatted file containing the private key for the specified certificate_file

Must be specified if certificate_file is being used.



private_key_password:: Password used to decrypt the private key file.

Should only be specified in the private_key_file is encrypted.



random_file:: Source of random data used for various cryptographic functions.



check_cert:: Server certificate verification requirements.

May be one of:

[options="header,autowidth"]
|===
| Option | Description
| `no`   | Server certificate can be signed by any CA or be self-signed.
| `yes`  | Server certificate must be issued by one of the trusted CAs.
|===

Default is `yes`



check_cert_cn:: Server certificate CN verification requirements.

May be one of:

[options="header,autowidth"]
|===
| Option | Description
| `no`   | Server certificate CN can be any value.
| `yes`  | Server certificate CN matches the host in the URI.
|===

Default is `yes`



extract_cert_attrs:: Extract OIDs from presented certificates as OIDs.

Default is `no`



connect_uri:: It will open a connection to the server specified in `connect_uri`
to populate the connection cache, ready for the first request.

If you wish to disable this pre-caching and reachability check,
comment out the configuration item below.

WARNING: The server will not start if the server specified is unreachable.



connect_proxy:: Proxy server used for all outbound connections.



http_negotiation:: The negotiation scheme and target HTTP version.

May be one of:

[options="header,autowidth"]
|===
| Option     | Description
| `default`  | Use whichever negotiation scheme and version is the default
               for `libcurl`.
| `1.0`      | Disable negotiation.  Force HTTP `1.0`.
| `1.1`      | Disable negotiation.  Force HTTP `1.1`.
| `2.0`      | Disable negotiation.  Force HTTP `2.0`.
| `2.0+auto` | Try and negotiate 2.0 and fallback to `1.1`.
| `2.0+tls`  | For `https` try and negotiate 2.0 and fallback to `1.1`.
               For `http` try and negotiate 2.0 and fallback to `1.1`.
|===



multiplex:: Execute multiple requests simultaneously using the same HTTP connection.

NOTE: HTTP >= 2.0 is required for multiplexing to succeed. If we can't negotiate
a high enough http version, multiplexing will be silently disabled.



chunk:: Max chunk-size.



## Sections

The following config items can be used in each of the sections.
The sections themselves reflect the sections in the server.

For example, if you list `rest` in the `authorize` section of a `virtual server`,
the settings from the `authorize` section here will be used.

The following config items may be listed in any of the sections:

[options="header,autowidth"]
|===
| Option         | Description
| `uri`          | To send the request to.
| `proxy`        | Rhe request via this server, supports `socks/http/https` uri and `:port`.
| `method`       | HTTP method to use, one of 'get', 'post', 'put', 'patch',
                   'delete' or any custom HTTP method.
| `body`         | The format of the HTTP body sent to the remote server.
                   May be 'none', 'post' or 'json', defaults to 'none'.
| `data`         | Send custom freeform data in the HTTP body. `Content-type`
                   may be specified with `body`. Will be expanded.
                   Values from expansion will not be escaped, this should be
                   done using the appropriate `xlat` method e.g. `%{urlencode:<attr>}`
| `force_to`     | Force the response to be decoded with this decoder.
                   May be 'plain' (creates reply.REST-HTTP-Body), 'post' or 'json'.
| `tls`          | TLS settings for HTTPS.
| `auth`         | HTTP auth method to use, one of 'none', 'srp', 'basic',
                   'digest', 'digest-ie', 'gss-negotiate', 'ntlm',
                   'ntlm-winbind', 'any', 'safe'. defaults to _'none'_.
| `username`     | User to authenticate as, will be expanded.
| `password`     | Password to use for authentication, will be expanded.
| `require_auth` | Require HTTP authentication.
| `timeout`      | HTTP request timeout in seconds, defaults to 4.0.
| `max_body_in`  | Maximum size of incoming HTTP body, defaults to 16k.
|===

Additional HTTP headers may be specified with `control.REST-HTTP-Header`.

The values of those attributes should be in the format:

  <attribute>: <value>

`control.REST-HTTP-Header` attributes will be consumed after each call
to the rest module, and each `%{rest:}` expansion.



.Body encodings are the same for requests and responses

POST - All attributes and values are urlencoded.

e.g:

`[outer.][<list>.]<attribute0>=<value0>&[outer.][<list>.]<attributeN>=<valueN>`

JSON - All attributes and values are escaped according to the JSON specification.

e.g:

[source,json]
----
{
    "<attribute0>":{
        "type":"<type0>",
        "value":[<value0>,<value1>,<valueN>]
    },
    "<attribute1>":{
        "type":"<type1>",
        "value":[...]
    },
    "<attributeN>":{
        "type":"<typeN>",
        "value":[...]
    },
}
----

The response format adds three optional fields:

[options="header,autowidth"]
|===
| Fields    | Description
| `do_xlat` | If `true`, any values will be xlat expanded. Defaults to `true`.
| `is_json` | If `true`, any nested JSON data will be copied to the attribute
              in string form. Defaults to `true`.
| `op`      | Controls how the attribute is inserted into the target list.
              Defaults to `:=`.
|===

[source,json]
----
{
    "[outer.][<list>.]<attribute0>":{
        "is_json":<bool>,
        "do_xlat":<bool>,
        "op":"<operator>",
        "value":[<value0>,<value1>,<valueN>]
    },
    "<attribute1>":"value",
    "<attributeN>":{
        "value":[<value0>,<value1>,<valueN>],
        "op":"+="
    }
}
----

[NOTE]
====
  * Module return codes are determined by HTTP response codes. These vary depending on the
section.

  * If the `body` is processed and found to be malformed or unsupported `fail` will be returned.
  * If the `body` is processed and found to contain attribute updated will be returned,
except in the case of a `401` code.
====



xlat { ... }::: Allows a subset of section configuration items to be configured for
any calls to this module's `xlat` function.



### Authorize { ... }

[options="header,autowidth"]
|===
| Code | Meaning      | Process body? | Module code
| 404  | not found    | no            | notfound
| 410  | gone         | no            | notfound
| 403  | forbidden    | no            | disallow
| 401  | unauthorized | yes           | reject
| 204  | no content   | no            | ok
| 2xx  | successful   | yes           | ok/updated
| 5xx  | server error | no            | fail
| xxx  | -            | no            | invalid
|===



### Authenticate { ... }

Same as `Authorize { ... }`



### Accounting { ... }

[options="header,autowidth"]
|===
| Code | Meaning      | Process body? | Module code
| 204  | no content   | no            | ok
| 2xx  | successful   | yes           | ok/updated
| 5xx  | server error | no            | fail
| xxx  | -            | no            | invalid
|===



### Post-Auth { ... }

Same as `Accounting { ... }`



pool { ... }::

This pool controls the number of handles available per-thread.

Each handle represents a single HTTP request.

[NOTE]
====
  * With HTTP <= 1.1, each request is bound to a single connection
so this pool, so these configuration items are useful for limiting
the number of outbound requests to the server.

  * With HTTP >= 2.0 with multiplexing enabled, multiple requests are
sent over a single HTTP connection, so the pool is more useful
for limiting the number of outstanding requests, and allowing for
handle reuse.
====


start:: Connections to create during module instantiation.
If the server cannot create specified number of connections
during instantiation it will exit.

Set to `0` to allow the server to start without the web service
being available.



min:: Minimum number of connections to keep open.



max:: Maximum number of connections.

If these connections are all in use and a new one
is requested, the request will NOT get a connection.

Setting `max` to LESS than the number of threads means
that some threads may starve, and you will see errors
like 'No connections available and at max connection limit'

Setting `max` to MORE than the number of threads means
that there are more connections than necessary.



spare:: Spare connections to be left idle.

NOTE: Idle connections WILL be closed if `idle_timeout`
is set.  This should be less than or equal to `max` above.



uses:: Number of uses before the connection is closed.

NOTE: `0` means "infinite".



retry_delay:: The number of seconds to wait after the server tries
to open a connection, and fails.

During this time, no new connections will be opened.



lifetime:: The lifetime (in seconds) of the connection.

NOTE: `0` means "infinite".



idle_timeout:: The idle timeout (in seconds).

A connection which is unused for this length of time will be closed.

NOTE: `0` means "infinite".



connect_timeout:: Connection timeout (in seconds).

The maximum amount of time to wait for a new connection to be established.



[NOTE]
====
All configuration settings are enforced.  If a connection is closed because of
`idle_timeout`, `uses`, or `lifetime`, then the total number of connections MAY
fall below `min`.

When that happens, it will open a new connection.  It will also log a *WARNING*
message.

The solution is to either lower the "min" connections,
or increase lifetime/idle_timeout.

= Linelog Module

The `linelog` module will log entries from attributes, string expansions,
or static strings, and writes them to a variety of backends, including syslog,
flat files, and raw UDP/TCP sockets.

NOTE: Multiple linelog's modules may be used for any given request.
The `logtee` modules will not affect normal logging output.
i.e. This logging is *in addition* to any other logging that is
done by the server.



## Configuration Settings


delimiter::  Custom line delimiters.

Defaults to `\n` (newline) but may be any UTF8 multi-character
string.



format:: The default format string. May be an attribute reference.

e.g. `&User-Name`, or `xlat`, `literal` or `exec`.



[NOTE]
====
The `reference` configuration item can be omitted.  If it
is omitted, then the log message is static, and is always
given by `format`, above.

If `reference` is defined, then the value is dynamically
expanded, and the result is used to find another
configuration entry here, with the given name.  That name
is then used as the format string.

If the configuration entry cannot be found, then no log
message is printed.

i.e: You can have many log messages in one `linelog` module.
If this two-step expansion did not exist, you would have
needed to configure one `linelog` module for each log message.
====



reference::

Reference the `Packet-Type` (`link:https://freeradius.org/rfc/rfc2865.html#Access-Request[Access-Request]`, etc.)  If
`reference` is commented out, the `format` entry above is
used instead.

May be an attribute reference, e.g. `&User-Name`, or `xlat`, `literal` or `exec`.



messages { ... }::

The messages defined here are chosen from the `reference`
expansion, above.

Pairs may be attributes attribute reference `&User-Name` , `xlat`, `literal` or `exec`.




header:: Optional header line format for file output

If the destination is "file" and header is set, then this
is expanded and output as the first line when a new file
is created.



destination:: What should be done with log messages.

May be one of:

[options="header,autowidth"]
|===
| Option  | Description
| file    | Write to a file.
| request | Write to the logging destination of the current request
| stdout  | Write to stdout
| stderr  | Write to stderr
| syslog  | Send via the system's syslog() function.
| tcp     | Write to a TCP socket.
| udp     | Write to a UDP socket.
| unix    | Write to a UNIX socket.
|===

The `stdout` and `stderr` destinations are likely to work only when
the server is running in debug mode.  When the server is running in
background mode, both `stdout` and `stderr` are usually redirected
to `/dev/null`.



.File as the destination for log messages.


filename:: The file where the logs will go.

WARNING: We STRONGLY suggest that you do not use
data from the packet as part of the filename.  This
data is untrusted, and may play games with your
file system!  If it is necessary you must set
`escape_filenames = yes` in order to prevent
security issues.



permissions:: The Unix-style permissions on the log file.

Depending on format string, the log file may contain secret or
private information about users.  Keep the file permissions as
restrictive as possible.



group:: The Unix group which owns the log file.

The user that freeradius runs as must be in the specified
group, otherwise it will not be possible to set the group.



escape_filenames::

Most file systems can handle nearly the full range
of UTF-8 characters.  Ones that can only deal with
a limited range should set this to `yes`.



The connection pool for TCP and Unix socket connections.


start:: Connections to create during module instantiation.

If the server cannot create specified number of
connections during instantiation it will exit.
Set to `0` to allow the server to start without the
external service being available.



min:: Minimum number of connections to keep open.



max:: Maximum number of connections.

If these connections are all in use and a new one
is requested, the request will NOT get a connection.

Setting `max` to *LESS* than the number of threads means
that some threads may starve, and you will see errors
like _No connections available and at max connection limit_.

Setting `max` to MORE than the number of threads means
that there are more connections than necessary.

If `max` is not specified, then it defaults to the number
of workers configured.



spare:: Spare connections to be left idle.

NOTE: Idle connections WILL be closed if `idle_timeout`
is set.  This should be less than or equal to `max` above.



uses:: Number of uses before the connection is closed.

`0` means "infinite"



retry_delay::

The number of seconds to wait after the server tries
to open a connection, and fails.  During this time,
no new connections will be opened.



lifetime:: The lifetime (in seconds) of the connection.



idle_timeout:: A connection which is unused for this length
of time will be closed.

Default `60` seconds.



NOTE: All configuration settings are enforced.  If a
connection is closed because of `idle_timeout`,
`uses`, or `lifetime`, then the total number of
connections MAY fall below `min`.  When that
happens, it will open a new connection.  It will
also log a WARNING message.

The solution is to either lower the `min` connections,
or increase `lifetime`/`idle_timeout`.



.UNIX socket-file as destination


filename:: Full path to the `unix socket` file.



pool:: The `pool { ... }` of connections.



.TCP-server as a destination


server:: Server to connect to.



port:: Port to connect to.



timeout:: Connect and write timeout (in seconds).



pool:: The `pool { ... }` of connections.



.UDP-server as a destination


server:: Server to connect to.



port:: Port to connect to.



timeout:: Connect and write timeout (in seconds).



pool:: The `pool { ... }` of connections.



.Syslog-server as a destination


facility:: Syslog facility (if logging via syslog).

Defaults to the syslog_facility config item in radiusd.conf.

Standard facilities are:

[options="header,autowidth"]
|===
| Option     | Description
| kern       | Messages generated by the kernel.  These cannot
               be generated by any user processes.
| user       | Messages generated by random user processes.
               This is the default facility identifier if
               none is specified.
| mail       | The mail system.
| daemon     | System daemons, such as routed(8), that are not
               provided for explicitly by other facilities.
| auth       | The authorization system: login(1), su(1),
               getty(8), etc.
| lpr        | The line printer spooling system: cups-lpd(8),
               cupsd(8), etc.
| news       | The network news system.
| uucp       | The uucp system.
| cron       | The cron daemon: cron(8).
| authpriv   | The same as LOG_AUTH, but logged to a file
               readable only by selected individuals.
| ftp        | The file transfer protocol daemons: ftpd(8),
               tftpd(8).
| local[0-7] | Reserved for local use.
|===

Default is `daemon`.



severity:: Syslog severity (if logging via `syslog`).

Possible values are:

[options="header,autowidth"]
|===
| Option     | Description
| emergency  | A panic condition.  This is normally broadcast
               to all users.
| alert      | A condition that should be corrected immediately,
               such as a corrupted system database.
| critical   | Critical conditions, e.g., hard device errors.
| error      | Errors.
| warning    | Warning messages.
| notice     | Conditions that are not error conditions, but
               should possibly be handled specially.
| info       | Informational messages.
| debug      | Messages that contain information normally of use
               only when debugging a program.
|===

Defaults is `info`.



## Sample

Another example, for accounting packets.


Please see the `linelog` module for common configuration explanation.






Example for `link:https://freeradius.org/rfc/rfc2866.html#Accounting-Request[Accounting-Request]`.


Don't log anything for these packets.


Don't log anything for other `link:https://freeradius.org/rfc/rfc2866.html#Acct-Status-Type[Acct-Status-Type]` 's.


## Authentication success / failure logging

A set of sample module instances which can replace the previous builtin auth log messages

The destination settings here pick up from the main radiusd.conf values, but can be
amended if these logs need to be sent to a different destination.

== Syslog 

For the example we will be using local1 as the facility. 

We will discuss the different priorities with regard to the types of messages that are produced. Keep in mind that the file locations may be different for your distribution.

There are different parts of the configuration that need updating depending on whether the main server or module logs should be sent to the syslog server. The process to get the main FreeRADIUS server logs to use syslog is fairly straight forward.  The basic steps are:

* Modify ``/etc/syslog.conf``
* Restart the syslog daemon 
* Modify ``/etc/raddb/radiusd.conf``
* Restart the FreeRADIUS daemon
 
=== Modify /etc/syslog.conf

Radius logging choices - Commented lines are not required::

 # .=notice will log only authentication messages (L_AUTH)
 #local1.=notice                     /var/log/radius/radius-notice.log
 # .=err will log only module errors for radius
 #local1.=err                         /var/log/radius/radius-errors.log
 # .* will log all messages in the same log file
 local1.*                                /var/log/radius/radius.log

=== Restart the syslog daemon

On the distro we use it is - services restart sysklogd

* RedHat - service syslog restart
* Debian/Ubuntu - /etc/init.d/rsyslog restart
* FreeBSD - /etc/rc.d/syslogd restart

=== Modify ``/etc/raddb/radiusd.conf``

Set the following options:

  log {
    destination = syslog
    syslog_facility = local1
  }

=== Module configuration

As an example we will use rlm_linelog. Modules differ, but are essentially the same idea. See the documentation in the module configuration.

Update the module config in ``raddb/mods-available/linelog`` and set::

  filename = syslog

You can also set the following, if required::

  syslog_facility = local1
  syslog_priority = info

=== Syslog Priorities

There are 8 different priorities for syslog - debug, info, notice, warning, err, crit, alert, emerg.

* debug - ?
* info - ?
* notice - authentication messages
* warning - ?
* err - radius errors
* crit - ?
* alert - ?
* emerg - ?

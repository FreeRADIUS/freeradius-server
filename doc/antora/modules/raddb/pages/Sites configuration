The `sites-available`, `sites-enabled` convention has been
borrowed from Apache, Nginx, and other similar projects.

As of FreeRADIUS 2.x.x virtual servers are located in the
`raddb/sites-available` subdirectory of the main configuration
directory. Each of these files contains a `server <name> {}`
stanza to declare a server configuration, which may then contain a
`listen {}` stanza to bind that server to a given ip/port.

The files from `raddb/sites-available` are symbolically linked
(symlinked) from the `raddb/sites-enabled` directory. This
allows the administrator to selectively enable and disable virtual
servers.

Every file in `raddb/sites-enabled` is `$INCLUDE`'d from
radiusd.conf.

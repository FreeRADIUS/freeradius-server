= VMPS

The VLAN Mangement Policy Server(VMPS)
system allows administrators to assign machines to a VLAN based on their
MAC address. The protocol itself was designed by Cisco, and is only
implemented on some Cisco switches.

In v4, all "server" sections MUST start with a "namespace"
parameter.  This tells the server which protocol is being used.

All of the subsequent "listen" sections in this server will
only accept packets for that protocol.



transport::



type:: Type of VMPS packets to listen for.



ipaddr:: VMPS sockets only support IPv4 addresses.



port:: Port on which to listen.

NOTE: 1589 is the default VMPS port.



Some systems support binding to an interface, in addition
to the IP address.  This feature isn't strictly necessary,
but for sites with many IP addresses on one interface,
it's useful to say "listen on all addresses for eth0".

If your system does not support this feature, you will
get an error if you try to use it.



You can list multiple "client" sections here in order to define
clients which apply only to this virtual server.  i.e. only for
the VMPS protocol.



This section is called when it receives a Join-Request.


Some requests may not have a MAC address.  Try to
create one using other attributes.


Do a simple mapping of MAC to VLAN.

See `raddb/mods-available/mac2vlan` for the definition of the "mac2vlan"
module.



required VMPS reply attributes




NOTE: If you have VLAN's in a database, you can `select`
the VLAN name based on the MAC address.



This section is called when it sends a Join-Response.



This section is called when it receives a Reconfirm-Request.

This section is called when not responding to packets.


== Default Configuration

```
#	As of version 2.0.0, the server also supports the VMPS
#	protocol.
server vmps {
	namespace = vmps
	listen {
		transport = udp
		type = Join-Request
		type = Reconfirm-Request
		udp {
			ipaddr = *
			port = 1589
#			interface = eth0
		}
	}
	recv Join-Request {
		if (!&MAC-Address) {
			if (&Ethernet-Frame =~ /0x.{12}(..)(..)(..)(..)(..)(..).*/) {
				&request.MAC-Address = "%{1}:%{2}:%{3}:%{4}:%{5}:%{6}"
			}
			else {
				&request.MAC-Address = &Cookie
			}
		}
#		mac2vlan
		&reply.Packet-Type = Join-Response
		&reply.Error-Code = No-Error
		&reply.Cookie = &MAC-Address
		&reply.VLAN-Name = "please_use_real_vlan_here"
#		&reply.VLAN-Name = %sql("select ... where mac='%{MAC-Address}'")
	}
	send Join-Response {
		ok
	}
	recv Reconfirm-Request {
		ok
	}
	recv Reconfirm-Response {
		ok
	}
	send Do-Not-Respond {
		ok
	}
}
```

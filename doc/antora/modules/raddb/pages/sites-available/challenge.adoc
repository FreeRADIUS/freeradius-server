If there's no State attribute, then this is the request from
the user.


Do authentication for step 2.
Set the "known good" password to the number
saved in the session-state list.


If the password doesn't match, the user is rejected
immediately.


Set the random number to save.



Send an Access-Challenge.
See raddb/policy.d/control for the definition
of "challenge"



Do PAP authentication with the password.


== Default Configuration

```
#	This file gives an example of using Challenge-Response
#	In this example, the user logs in with a password, which has
#	to be "hello".  The server will send them a challenge
#	consisting of a random number 0..9.  The user has to respond
#	with that number.
listen {
	type = auth
	ipaddr = *
	port = 2000
	virtual_server = challenge
}
server challenge {
recv Access-Request {
	if (!State) {
		update control {
			Auth-Type := Step1
			Password.Cleartext := "hello"
		}
	}
	else {
		update control {
			Auth-Type := Step2
			Password.Cleartext := &session-state.Tmp-Integer-0
		}
	}
}

	}
	update reply {

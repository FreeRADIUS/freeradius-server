Packets received on the socket will be processed through one
of the following sections, named after the DHCP packet type.
See dictionary.dhcp for the packet types.
IP Address of the DHCP server
IP Address of the DHCP relay (ourselves)

IP Address of the DHCP server

== Default Configuration

```
#	This is a virtual server that handles DHCP relaying
#	Only one server can listen on a socket, so you cannot
#	do DHCP relaying && run a DHCP server at the same time.
server dhcp.eth1 {
	listen {
		ipaddr = *
		port = 67
		type = dhcp
		interface = eth1
	}
	dhcp Discover {
		update config {
			&Relay-To-IP-Address := 192.0.2.2
		}
		update request {
			&Gateway-IP-Address := 192.0.2.1
		}
		ok
	}
	dhcp Request {
		update config {
			&Relay-To-IP-Address := 192.0.2.2
		}
		update request {
			&Gateway-IP-Address := 192.0.2.2

		ok
	}

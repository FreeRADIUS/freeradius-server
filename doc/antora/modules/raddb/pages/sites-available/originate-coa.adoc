= Originate CoA-Request packets

The server can originate Change of Authorization (CoA) or
Disconnect request packets.  These packets are used to dynamically
change the parameters of a users session (bandwidth, etc.), or
to forcibly disconnect the user.

There are some caveats.  Not all NAS vendors support this
functionality.  Even for the ones that do, it may be difficult to
find out what needs to go into a CoA-Request or Disconnect-Request
packet.  All we can suggest is to read the NAS documentation
available from the vendor.  That documentation SHOULD describe
what information their equipment needs to see in a CoA packet.

This information is usually a list of attributes such as:


CoA packets can be originated when a normal Access-Request or
Accounting-Request packet is received.  Simply create a subrequest,
and call the `radius` module to send the packet.


Note that this functionality is configured differently from v3.



This is an *example* virtual server.  It accepts `link:https://freeradius.org/rfc/rfc2866.html#Accounting-Request[Accounting-Request]`
packets.  It then sends a `Disconnect-Request` packet for every
`link:https://freeradius.org/rfc/rfc2866.html#Accounting-Request[Accounting-Request]` packet it receives.

You should NOT enable this virtual server.  Instead, use it as an
example, and copy the "subrequest" section to the virtual server
that is actually receiving `link:https://freeradius.org/rfc/rfc2866.html#Accounting-Request[Accounting-Request]` packets.


Listen on the Accounting port.




The subrequest begins empty, so copy all necessary
attributes over.



Call the `radius` module to send a CoA packet.

Note that you MUST create an instance of the
`radius` module, called "radius.coa" in order for
this to work.

See the `radius` module for more documentation on
how it works.




== Default Configuration

```
#	NAS-IP-Address (or NAS-IPv6 address)
#	NAS-Identifier
#	User-Name
#	Acct-Session-Id
#	subrequest Disconnect-Request {
#	       &User-Name = &parent.request.User-Name
#	       &Acct-Session-Id = &parent.request.Acct-Session-Id
#	       &NAS-IP-Address = &parent.NAS-IP-Address}
#	       ...
#	}
server originate-coa.example.com {
	namespace = radius
	listen {
		type = Accounting-Request
		transport = udp
		udp {
			ipaddr = *
			port = 1812
		}
	}
recv Accounting-Request {
	subrequest Disconnect-Request {
		update request {
			&User-Name := &parent.request.User-Name
			&Acct-Session-Id := &parent.request.Acct-Session-Id
			&NAS-Identifier := &parent.request.NAS-Identifier
			&NAS-IP-Address := &parent.request.NAS-IP-Addres
			&NAS-IPv6-Address := &parent.request.NAS-IPv6-Address
			&NAS-Port := &parent.request.NAS-Port
			&Framed-IP-Address := &parent.request.Framed-IP-Address
		}
		radius.coa
	}
}  # recv Accounting-Request
}
```

This example is very simple.  All inner tunnel requests get
proxied to another RADIUS server.


Do other things here, as necessary.

e.g. run the "realms" module, to decide how to proxy
the inner tunnel request.


You should update this to be one of your realms.


This is necessary so that the inner tunnel EAP-MSCHAPv2
method can be called.  That method takes care of turning
EAP-MSCHAPv2 into plain MS-CHAPv2, if necessary.


== Default Configuration

```
#	This is a virtual server that handles *only* inner tunnel
#	requests for EAP-TTLS and PEAP types.
server proxy-inner-tunnel {
recv Access-Request {
	update control {
		&Proxy-To-Realm := "example.com"
	}
}
authenticate eap {
	eap
}
post-proxy {
}
}
```

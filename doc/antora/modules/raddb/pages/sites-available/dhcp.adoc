See raddb/mods-available/dhcp_sqlippool for the IP Pool configuration.

See raddb/policy.d/dhcp_sqlippool for the "glue" code that allows
the RADIUS based "sqlippool" module to be used for DHCP.

See raddb/mods-config/sql/ippool/ for the schemas.

See raddb/sites-available/dhcp for instructions on how to configure
the DHCP server.




The DHCP functionality goes into a virtual server.


Define a DHCP socket.

The default port below is 6700, so you don't break your network.
If you want it to do real DHCP, change this to 67, and good luck!

You can also bind the DHCP socket to an interface.
See below, and raddb/radiusd.conf for examples.

This lets you run *one* DHCP server instance and have it listen on
multiple interfaces, each with a separate policy.

If you have multiple interfaces, it is a good idea to bind the
listen section to an interface.  You will also need one listen
section per interface.



IP address to listen on. Will usually be the IP of the
interface, or 0.0.0.0

The port should be 67 for a production network. Don't set
it to 67 on a production network unless you really know
what you're doing. Even if nothing is configured below, the
server may still NAK legitimate responses from clients.
This is also the destination port when sending to a giaddr.

Interface name we are listening on. See comments above.

source IP address for unicast packets sent by the
DHCP server.

The source IP for unicast packets is chosen from the first
one of the following items which returns a valid IP
address:

     src_ipaddr
     ipaddr
     reply:DHCP-Server-IP-Address
     reply:DHCP-DHCP-Server-Identifier


The DHCP server defaults to allowing broadcast packets.
Set this to "no" only when the server receives *all* packets
from a relay agent.  i.e. when *no* clients are on the same
LAN as the DHCP server.

It's set to "no" here for testing. It will usually want to
be "yes" in production, unless you are only dealing with
relayed packets.

On Linux if you're running the server as non-root, you
will need to do:

sudo setcap cap_net_admin=ei /path/to/radiusd

This will allow the server to set ARP table entries
for newly allocated IPs


If there is no `client` entry in a DHCPv4 virtual server, it will
automatically create and use a "0/0" client.

If there is one or more clients defined in a DHCPv4 virtual server,
they will be used to limit source IP addresses for DHCPv4 packets.
Only packets from known clients or networks will be accepted.

If a `client` is defined, you should list all subnets used for end
user machines, along with all DHCPv4 gateways that send packets to
the server.

     ipaddr = 192.168.0.0/16

Packets received on the socket will be processed through one
of the following sections, named after the DHCP packet type.
See dictionary.dhcpv4 for the packet types.

Return packets will be sent to, in preference order:
   DHCP-Gateway-IP-Address
   DHCP-Client-IP-Address
   DHCP-Your-IP-Address
At least one of these attributes should be set at the end of each
section for a response to be sent.


Set the type of packet to send in reply.

The server will look at the DHCP-Message-Type attribute to
determine which type of packet to send in reply. Common
values would be DHCP-Offer, DHCP-Ack or DHCP-NAK. See
dictionary.dhcp for all the possible values.

DHCP-Do-Not-Respond can be used to tell the server to not
respond.

In the event that DHCP-Message-Type is not set then the
server will fall back to determining the type of reply
based on the rcode of this section.


The contents here are invented.  Change them!

Do a simple mapping of MAC to assigned IP.

See below for the definition of the "mac2ip"
module.

mac2ip

If the MAC wasn't found in that list, do something else.
You could call a Perl, Python, or Java script here.

if (notfound) {
...
}

Or, allocate IPs from the DHCP pool in SQL. You may need to
set the pool name here if you haven't set it elsewhere.

If DHCP-Message-Type is not set, returning "ok" or
"updated" from this section will respond with a DHCP-Offer
message.

Other rcodes will tell the server to not return any response.


Response packet type. See DHCP-Discover section above.

module.

}

Or, allocate IPs from the DHCP pool in SQL. You may need to
set the pool name here if you haven't set it elsewhere.

If DHCP-Message-Type is not set, returning "ok" or
"updated" from this section will respond with a DHCP-Ack
packet.

"handled" will not return a packet, all other rcodes will
send back a DHCP-NAK.


Other DHCP packet types

There should be a separate section for each DHCP message type.
By default this configuration will ignore them all. Any packet type
not defined here will be responded to with a DHCP-NAK.




For Windows 7 boxes



The thing being queried for is implicit
in the packets.

has MAC, asking for IP, etc.
look up MAC in database

has IP, asking for MAC, etc.
look up IP in database

has host name, asking for IP, MAC, etc.
look up identifier in database


stop processing


We presume that the database lookup returns "notfound"
if it can't find anything.



Add more logic here.  Is the lease inactive?
If so, respond with DHCP-Lease-Unassigned.

Otherwise, respond with DHCP-Lease-Active



Also be sure to return ALL information about
the lease.



The reply types are:

DHCP-Lease-Unknown
DHCP-Lease-Active
DHCP-Lease-Unassigned





This next section is a sample configuration for the "passwd"
module, that reads flat-text files.  It should go into
radiusd.conf, in the "modules" section.

The file is in the format <mac>,<ip>


This lets you perform simple static IP assignment.

There is a preconfigured "mac2ip" module setup in
mods-available/mac2ip. To use it do:

  # cd raddb/
  # ln -s ../mods-available/mac2ip mods-enabled/mac2ip
  # mkdir mods-config/passwd

Then create the file mods-config/passwd/mac2ip with the above
format.


This is an example only - see mods-available/mac2ip instead; do
not uncomment these lines here.

A virtual server which is used to validate channel-bindings.



Only the "authorize" section is needed.

In general this section should include a policy for each type
of channel binding that may be in use.  For example each lower
layer such as GSS-EAP (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7055[RFC 7055]) or IEEE 802.11I is likely to
need a separate channel binding policy.

== Default Configuration

```
server channel_bindings {
	recv Access-Request {
		abfab_channel_bindings
	}
}
```

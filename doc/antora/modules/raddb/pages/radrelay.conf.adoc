= Radrelay Configuration

Use with:

    radiusd -n radrelay

This file is a sample configuration that replaces the old
`radrelay` program.  It is a _minimal_ configuration that
does little more than read the `detail` file, and proxy the
packets to a home server.  If you need it to do more than
just replace `radrelay`, you will need to add additional
configuration.

See `raddb/sites-available/copy-acct-to-home-server` for a
more complete example.  That example is intended to be run
as part of a larger RADIUS configuration, where the server
also listens on ports 1812, etc.  The example given here
is a minimal example that has *only* `radrelay` functionality.

See `radiusd.conf` for a complete description of the configuration
parameters used here.

## Why radrelay is needed

Many sites run multiple radius servers; at least one primary and one
backup server. When the primary goes down, most NASes will detect that
and switch to the backup server.

That change will cause your accounting packets to go the the backup
server - and some NASes will not switch back to the primary server
when it comes back up.

The result is that accounting records are missed, and/or the
administrator must jump through hoops in order to combine the
different detail files from multiple servers. It also means that the
accounting database gets out of sync.

`radrelay` solves this issue by "relaying" packets from one server to
another, so they both have the same set of accounting data.

## Overload

If the RADIUS server suddenly receives a many accounting packets,
there may be insufficient CPU power to process them all in a timely
manner.  This problem is especially noticeable when the accounting
packets are going to a back-end database.

Similarly, you may have one database that tracks "live" sessions, and
another that tracks historical accounting data.  In that case,
accessing the first database is fast, as it is small.  Accessing the
second database many be slower, as it may contain multiple gigabytes
of data.  In addition, writing to the first database in a timely
manner is important, while data may be written to the second database
with a few minutes delay, without any harm being done.



## General definitions

The following options define where the server files are stored
when installed. They are set by 'make' at compile time, and it
is unlikely to need to change them.



name:: This is the name of the running server.

See also the `-n` command-line option.



Location of config and logfiles.



max_request_time::
cleanup_delay::

Request handling configuration.



## Logging configuration

The following section defines global server logging options.
For more configurable and detailed logging, the logging modules
should be used (`rlm_detail`, `rlm_linelog` etc.)


destination: Destination for log messages.

This can be one of:

|===
| Destination | Description
| files       | Log to `file`, as defined below.
| syslog      | To syslog (see also the `syslog_facility`, below.
| stdout      | Standard output.
| stderr      | Standard error.
|===

The command-line option `-X` over-rides this option, and forces
logging to go to stdout.



file:: The logging messages for the server are appended to the
tail of this file `if ${destination} == "files"`

NOTE: If the server is running in debugging mode, this file is
NOT used.



.SECURITY CONFIGURATION

There may be multiple methods of attacking on the server.  This
section holds the configuration items which minimize the impact
of those attacks


max_attributes:: The maximum number of attributes
permitted in a RADIUS packet.  Packets which have MORE
than this number of attributes in them will be dropped.

If this number is set too low, then no RADIUS packets
will be accepted.

If this number is set too high, then an attacker may be
able to send a small number of packets which will cause
the server to use all available memory on the machine.

Setting this number to 0 means "allow any number of attributes"



reject_delay && status_server don't apply when we are
only reading accounting packets from the detail file



allow_vulnerable_openssl: Allow the server to start with
versions of OpenSSL known to have critical vulnerabilities.

This check is based on the version number reported by libssl
and may not reflect patches applied to libssl by
distribution maintainers.



## Modules

If you need more modules, add them here. The `radrelay`
configuration is very simple, and only includes one module.



If you need to instantiate modules, add them here.



## Home server configuration


NOTE: Proxying has changed in v4.  This example is no longer correct.



Define a `home server`, which is where packets should be
relayed to.


type::



ipaddr:: This directive replaces the `-r` command-line option
in `radrelay`.



port::



src_ipaddr:: This directive replaces the `-i` command-line option
in `radrelay`.



secret:: This directive replaces the `-s`, `-S`, and `-n` command-line
options in `radrelay`.



List one or more home servers here for fail-over,
load-balancing, etc. By default we just send all relayed
packets to the one home server, `home1`, defined above.



Create a dummy realm that relays to the above server pool.



## Server configuration

We now define a virtual server to read RADIUS packets from a
'detail' file, and proxy them to the dummy realm above.


Read the detail file:


type::



filename:: The filename here should be the same as the one used by the
main `radiusd` program.

It writes the file using the `detail` module (see `raddb/modules/detail`).



load_factor::



This section is called when the server receives an
Accounting-Request packet (which will be from the
"detail" reader above.

See also `raddb/sites-available/copy-acct-to-home-server`
for additional description.


Proxy the packet using the given realm.
Note that we do not use the realm for anything else such
as prefix/suffix stripping, or comparisons.

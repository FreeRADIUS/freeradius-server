== Authorization, Authentication, and Accounting request handling

There are a lot of questions about misconfigured FreeRADIUS servers
because of misunderstanding of FreeRADIUS operations. This document
explains how the server operates.

Normally there are 2 steps in processing authentication request coming
from NAS in FreeRADIUS (plus additional steps to proxy request if we use
FreeRADIUS as a proxy): authorization and authentication.

=== Authorization

Authorization is a process of obtaining information about the user from
external source (file, database or LDAP), and checking that the
information in request is enough to authenticate user. Authorization
modules deal with data sources, so ldap, sql, files, passwd are
authorization modules.

The authentication method is decided during the authorization phase,
along with any reply attributes. The reason for this behaviour is that
for example, a user may not be permitted to use a particular
authentication method. So during the authorize phase, we can deny them
the ability to use that kind of authentication.

=== Authentication

Authentication is simply a process of comparing user’s credentials in
request with credentials stored in database. Authentication usually
deals with password encryption. `PAP`, `CHAP`, `MS-CHAP` are authentication
modules. Few modules act as both authorization and authentication. For
example, the `MS-CHAP` module is normally authentication only, but it may
be used during authorization to verify that request contains `MS-CHAP`
related attribute and only in this case perform `MS-CHAP` based
authentication. `LDAP` is normally an authorization module, but it may be
used for authentication (In this case FreeRADIUS will authenticate user
in case he can connect to LDAP server with his account). SQL is only an
authorization module, as dial-in users are not normally given passwords
to access an SQL server.

=== Request Processing

During authorization and authentication processes, there are 3 lists of
RADIUS attributes supported by FreeRADIUS: request items, config items
and reply items. (See `man 5 users` for additional information.)
Attributes from the RADIUS authentication request packet are included
into request items list. Both authorization and authentication modules
can add attributes into reply items list. These attributes will be added
to reply will be sent by RADIUS server to NAS. There is third list,
called config items. It’s used for internal FreeRADIUS operations, for
example to pass some data from authorization to authentication module.

Before authorization begins FreeRADIUS creates request items list with
attributes from request and empty config and reply lists.

An authorization module searches a database with attributes
(e.g. `User-Name`) taken from request list as a key, and fetches all
relevant records. It retrieves 3 types of attributes: check attributes,
configure attributes and reply attributes. It compares the check
attributes with attributes from request items. If none of database
record for this `User-Name` matches in check attributes with request items
authorization will fail. If a matching record is found, then the
configure attributes will be added to configure items, and the reply
attributes will be added to reply items list. The check list may be
required if we need to authenticate users with same name for different
services (for example to treat User1 from NAS1 and User1 from NAS2 as
different users).

There should be at list one configure attribute provided by
authorization module, called `Auth-Type` (since this attribute is from
config items list it can’t be in request or reply). This attribute
decides which module will be used to authenticate the user. The Config
items also contains information from database required to authenticate
user, for example valid user’s password or it’s hash, login
restrictions, etc.

A quite common mistake is to place the attributes in the wrong lists,
for example placing `Auth-Type`, `Password`, `NT-Password` etc in the check
list, or in the reply list. When run in debugging mode, the server will
normally issue `WARNING` messages saying that the attributes are in the
wrong list.

If you place Password into check list and user does cleartext
authentication it may work, because authorization module compares 2
cleartext passwords. But if user does some encrypted authentication (for
example `MS-CHAP`), then the authorization will fail, because the Password
in the request items will not match the password in the check
attributes. You should place Password attribute obtained from database
into configure items and also place Auth-Type attribute with value of
`MS-CHAP` into same list. The same goes for `NT-Password` (before calling
`MS-CHAP` Password attribute should be converted to `NT-Password`, it may be
achieved by calling mschap module in authorization section after module
which does actual authorization).

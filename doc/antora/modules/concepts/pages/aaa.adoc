== Authorization, Authentication, and Accounting request handling

There are a lot of questions about misconfigured FreeRADIUS servers
because of misunderstanding of FreeRADIUS operations. This document
explains how the server operates.

Normally there are two steps in processing an authentication request
coming from a NAS in FreeRADIUS: authorization and authentication.
If we use FreeRADIUS as a proxy to re-send the request to another
RADIUS server there will be additional steps.

=== Authorization

Authorization is the process of finding and returning information
about what the user is allowed to do.  For example, finding out what
kind of authentication methods they are allowed to run, and what VLAN
the user should be placed into.

Authorization modules generally "get data" from somewhere,
e.g. `ldap`, `sql`, `files`, etc.

The authentication method is usually determined when the server gets
the users credentials from a database.  Once the credentials are
available, the server can authenticate the user.

=== Authentication

Authentication is simply a process of comparing userâ€™s credentials in
request with the "known good" credentials retrieved from a
database. Authentication usually deals with password
encryption. The modules `pap`, `chap`, `mschap`, etc. do authentication.

Some modules do both authentication and limited authorization. For
example, the `mschap` module authenticates MS-CHAP credentials, but it
may also be used as an authorization module, which verifies that
request contains `MS-CHAP` related attribute.  If so, the module
instructs the server to use `mschap` for authentication, too

These dual modules are usually related to protocol-specific
attributes, such as the `pap` module for the `User-Password`
attribute, `chap` for `CHAP-Password`, `mschap` for `MS-CHAP-*`, etc.

=== Request Processing

When the server processes requests, it manages four
xref:reference:unlang/list.adoc[attribute lists].

.Attribute Lists and Details

[cols="1,2"]
|===
|Attribute List|Description

|`request`
|Attributes taken from the received packet.

|`reply`
|Attributes which will be sent in the reply.

|`control`
|Attributes used to control how the server operates.  These are never sent in a packet.

|`session-state`
|Attributes which are saved and restored across multiple request / reply exchanges.
|===

All of these lists are available to all modules.  All of these lists are available in xref:reference:unlang/index.adoc[Unlang]

=== Accounting

Accounting refers to the recording of resources a user consumes during the time they are on the network.
The information gathered can include the amount of system time used, the amount of data sent, or the
quantity of data received by the user during a session.

During a network session, the NAS periodically sends an accounting of user activity to the server. This
accounting is a summary, and the collected data is used for billing purposes.
ISPs are a large consumer of accounting data, because each user is billed for every minute of network
access. However, corporations have not, historically, relied on network accounting information gathered
by RADIUS because employees were not traditionally billed for network access. As their need for ongoing
network monitoring increases, though, so does the need to store and process accounting information.
The accounting summary sent by the NAS to the server does not include detailed information such as web
sites visited or even how many bytes were transferred using a particular protocol (SMTP, HTTP, and so
forth). That type of detailed information is only available to the NAS, and it does not send that data to the
server.

If detailed information about user activity is required, network administrators can obtain it through other
protocols such as sFlow or NetFlow. Network administrators may find it difficult to tie the pieces together to get a more comprehensive
understanding of user activity.

= Virtual Servers

The idea of virtual servers (or virtual hosts) was first
introduced in web servers such as Apache. FreeRADIUS is the first RADIUS
server to implement this functionality.

This functionality is different from running a RADIUS server inside of a
virtual machine such as
Xen or VMware. It does not offer the same protection as a virtual
machine, but it is often much easier to configure and maintain.

== Background

RADIUS servers have traditionally had one configuration, and one global
policy that was applied to all incoming requests. That global policy was
usually configured to select one or more sub-policies (e.g. per-client
or per-user). The process of creating and maintaining those policies has
often been difficult.

The largest problem in creating and maintaining these policies was in
ensuring that changes to one sub-policy did not affect another
independent sub-policy. As the number of users, devices, and policies
increases, the effort required to debug these policies becomes
significant. Virtual servers simplify this process considerably.

In FreeRADIUS 2.0, virtual servers can be configured independently for
each of server IP address, client IP address, home
server pool, and inner TLS tunnel.

IP based
--------

The server can listen on multiple IP addresses, and each IP address can
have it's own independent policy for incoming packets. For example, the
following configuration enables the server to listen on two IP
addresses, and to apply independent policies to packets received on each
IP address.
----
listen {
    ipaddr = 192.0.2.1
    port = 1812
    type = auth
    virtual_server = one
}
    
listen {
    ipaddr = 192.0.2.2
    port = 1812
    type = auth
    virtual_server = two
}
    
server one {
    ...
}
    
server two {
    ...
}
----

When packets are received on the IP address `192.0.2.1`, they will be
processed through the `server one` virtual server. When packets are
received on the IP address `192.0.2.2`, they will be processed through
the `server two` virtual server.

The contents of the `server one` and `server two` sections are
`authorize`, `authenticate`, etc. sections used to process packets in
version 1.x.

Client based
------------

The server identifies RADIUS clients by IP address, and each client can
have it's own independent policy based on client source IP address. For
example, the following configuration enables the server to have two
clients, and to apply independent policies to packets received from each
IP address.
----
listen {
    ipaddr = 192.0.2.3
    port = 1812
    type = auth
    # no server section is defined here
    clients = disambiguate
}
    
clients disambiguate {
    client one {
        ipaddr = 192.0.2.4
        secret = testing123
        virtual_server = one
    }
    client two {
        ipaddr = 192.0.2.5
        secret = testing567
        virtual_server = two
    }
}
...
# server one as above
# server two as above
----

When packets are received on the IP address `192.0.2.3`, they will be
processed through the `server one` virtual server if they are received
from `client one`. When packets are received on the same IP address
(`192.0.2.3`), they will be processed through the `server two` virtual
server if they are received from `client two`.

Both *IP based* and *client based* servers can be used at the same time,
so long as there is only one way to map an incoming request to a virtual
server. If the same request can map to multiple virtual servers,
FreeRADIUS will return an error, and will refuse to start.

Home Server Pool based
----------------------

The server identifies RADIUS home servers by server pools for fail-over
and redundancy. Each home server pool can have it's own independent
policy based on where the packet is being proxied. For example, the
following configuration enables the server to have two home server
pools, and to apply independent policies to packets that are proxied to
home servers in each pool.

        ...
        home_server_pool one {
            type = fail-over
            home_server = 192.0.2.10
            home_server = 192.0.2.11
            home_server = 192.0.2.12
            virtual_server = proxy-pool-one
        }
        home_server_pool two {
            type = fail-over
            home_server = 192.0.2.13
            home_server = 192.0.2.14
            home_server = 192.0.2.15
            virtual_server = proxy-pool-two
        }
        ...
    }
    ...
    server proxy-pool-one {
        pre-proxy {
            ...
        }
        post-proxy {
            ...
        }
    }
    server proxy-pool-two {
        pre-proxy {
            ...
        }
        post-proxy {
            ...
        }
    }

When requests are sent to one of the home servers listed in the pool,
they will be processed through the `server proxy-pool-one`, or the
`server proxy-pool-two` virtual server.

TLS Tunnels
-----------

The EAP tunneled methods present an authentication request
to FreeRADIUS inside of the TLS tunnel. The `eap` module can map these
tunneled requests to a virtual server. This mapping enables *completely
independent* policies for each of the outer and inner tunneled sessions.
This configuration was not possible in earlier versions of FreeRADIUS.

    modules {
        ...
        eap {
            ttls {
                ...
                virtual_server = inner-tunnel
            }
            peap {
                ...
                virtual_server = inner-tunnel
            }
        }
        ...
    }
    ...
    server inner-tunnel {
        ...
    }

When requests are received inside of a TTLS or PEAP tunnel, they will be
processed through the `server inner-tunnel` virtual server.

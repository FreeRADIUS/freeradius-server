= Authentication with LDAP

The FreeRADIUS is an AAA server, and LDAP servers function primarily as a *database* that stores user credentials and related information. FreeRADIUS handles the authentication protocols such as `PAP`, `CHAP`, or `MS-CHAP`.  LDAP is a backend accessed by the RADIUS server to verify user credentials. The xref:reference:raddb/mods-available/ldap.adoc[ldap module] interacts with these protocols by retrieving and comparing data. The FreeRADIUS server performs the authentication logic, not the LDAP server.

This separation of roles means that FreeRADIUS supports multiple kinds of authentication protocols whereas a LDAP database works only the authentication method "bind as user".  This authentication method is compatible only with PAP.

Our recommendation is to use LDAP as a database.  FreeRADIUS reads the "known good" password from LDAP, and then use that information to authenticate the user.  It's not recommended to use the LDAP "bind as user" method for authenticating users.

The only caveat to the above recommendation is Active Directory.  For
"security" reasons, Active Directory will not return the "known good"
password to FreeRADIUS over a standard LDAP query.  Therefore when
Active Directory is used, the choices are:

PAP::
Use "bind as user".

MS-CHAP::
Use xref:reference:raddb/mods-available/ntlm_auth.adoc[`ntlm`] or xref:reference:raddb/mods-available/winbind.adoc[`winbind`].

Due to these limitations of Active Directory, there are no
other alternatives.

== LDAP Security Recommendations

The credentials (username *and* password) for FreeRADIUS to use to
connect to your LDAP server(s) should be secure.  We make the
following recommendations for LDAP "best practices" security.

* Create a dedicated account for use by FreeRADIUS.

* Ensure that this account does not have administrator access.

* Ensure that this account is read-only, and has no write permissions.

* Start by using *simple authentication* instead of
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_Authentication_and_Security_Layer[SASL].
  The SASL protocol should be attempted only after 'simple authentication' has been verified to work.

* Use TLS for connecting between FreeRADIUS and the LDAP server.  See
  the `tls` sub-section of the default `ldap` module for instructions.

* When storing RADIUS user profiles (quotas, `Simultaneous-Use` flags,
  access time restrictions, etc.) in LDAP, the LDAP schema
  `doc/schemas/ldap/openldap/freeradius-radius.schema` must first be imported
  into the LDAP server.

== Authentication Method Compatibility

The LDAP module is compatible a few different kinds of authentication
methods.  Note that we say _compatible_, and not _supports_.  LDAP
servers are databases, and do not support authentication protocols
such as CHAP, MS-CHAP, or EAP.

PAP::
The user supplies a `User-Password` (plaintext or EAP-TTLS/PAP).
+
FreeRADIUS reads the "known good" password from LDAP, and compares
that to what the user entered.

Bind as user::
The user supplies a `User-Password` (plaintext or EAP-TTLS/PAP).
+
FreeRADIUS uses that password to "bind as the user" to LDAP, using the
supplied `User-Name` and `User-Password.  If the bind is successful,
the user is authenticated.  Otherwise, authentication fails.

CHAP::
The user supplies a `CHAP` password attribute.
+
FreeRADIUS reads the "known good" password from LDAP in cleartext, and
compares that to what the user entered.

MS-CHAP::
The user supplies a `MS-CHAP` password attribute.  Either as
MS-CHAPv2, or as PEAP/MSCHAPv2, or as EAP-TTLS/MS-CHAPv2.
+
FreeRADIUS reads the "known good" password from LDAP in cleartext, or
as an NT hash, and compares that to what the user entered.

All of these authentication methods except "bind as user" require
that FreeRADIUS obtain the `userPassword` field from LDAP.  If that
field is not returned to FreeRADIUS, then normal authentication is
impossible.  Either FreeRADIUS has to be configured to use "bind as
user" for authentication, or the LDAP database has to be updated to
return the `userPassword` field to FreeRADIUS.  This change usually
involves giving the FreeRADIUS "read-only" user permission to read the
`userPassword` field.

The best method to test authentication is with the
xref:howto:modules/ldap/ldapsearch/index.adoc[ldapsearch] tool.
These tests *must* be run prior to configuring FreeRADIUS.  We strongly
recommend having the LDAP database return the `userPassword` field to
FreeRADIUS, so that FreeRADIUS can authenticate the user.

We strongly recommend that the passwords be stored in LDAP as
cleartext.  Otherwise, the only authentication methods that will work
are PAP and EAP-TTLS/PAP.  The next section explains these issues in
more detail.

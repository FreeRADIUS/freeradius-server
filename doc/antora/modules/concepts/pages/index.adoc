= Concepts

The Concepts section is for users who are new to RADIUS and want to understand its purpose, functionality, and role within a network. It introduces the main ideas behind RADIUS and its use for network authentication, authorization, and accounting. This background knowledge prepares you for a deeper exploration or practical application of RADIUS in real-world scenarios.

== xref:concepts:overview.adoc[Overview]

This section introduces the RADIUS server, FreeRADIUS, and its core services.Its modular architecture, scalability, and support for various authentication types make it suitable for organizations of all sizes.

=== xref:freeradius.adoc[What is FreeRADIUS]
FreeRADIUS is a widely used open-source RADIUS server offering authentication, authorization, and accounting services. Learn about the benefits of using the open-source software version.

=== xref:aaa/aaa.adoc[Authentication Authorization Accounting (AAA)]
Details the AAA framework, which is central to RADIUS operations. The framework is divided in the three distinct functionalities. xref:aaa/authz.adoc[Authorization] is the process of allowing an authenticated user to access services on the network. xref:aaa/authn.adoc[Authentication] is the verification process of validating an end-user's credentials. xref:aaa/acct.adoc[Accounting] operations tracks an end-user's time and access on the network for auditing or billing purposes.

=== xref:components/architecture.adoc[RADIUS System Components]
The architecture and main components of a RADIUS system are explained such as: the xref:components/nas.adoc[Network Access Server (NAS)], which manages user access and enforces network policies; xref:components/radius_servers.adoc[RADIUS Server], which handles authentication, authorization, and policy enforcement; and xref:components/datastore.adoc[Datastores], which are used to store information such as user credentials and session data. Each linked topic provides detailed information about how these components operate and interact within a RADIUS-based network.

=== xref:session/radius_session.adoc[RADIUS Sessions]
Explains what RADIUS sessions are and how they're managed in a network. xref:session/radius_session_msg.adoc[Session Messages] details the format and content of session messages. xref:session/processing.adoc[Processing] describes the implementation and processing flow for AAA services.

== xref:protocol/authproto.adoc[Protocols]
Defines the protocols used in the RADIUS ecosystem by the various components. RADIUS, an application layer protocol using UDP, manages network access with authentication and network protocols. It uses MD5 for packet authentication and supports various authentication methods like EAP, PAP, CHAP, and MS-CHAP.

== xref:modules/ldap/authentication.adoc[Authentication with LDAP]
Describes how a LDAP integration is used for user authentication with some examples for select vendors. xref:modules/ldap/password_storage.adoc[Password Storage] explains the methods of how the user's information can be stored. xref:modules/ldap/novell.adoc[Integrate Novell] provides information on integrating Novell with RADIUS networks using LDAP.

== xref:resources.adoc[Resources]
Provides links to further help, mailing lists, and related documentation to support users in deploying FreeRADIUS.

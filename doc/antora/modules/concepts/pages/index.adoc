= Concepts

The Concepts guide is designed for users who are new to RADIUS and want to understand its purpose, functionality, and role within a network. It introduces the main ideas behind RADIUS and its use for network authentication, authorization, and accounting. This background knowledge prepares you for a deeper exploration or practical application of RADIUS in real-world scenarios.

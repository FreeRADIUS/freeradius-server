# Troubleshooting

## The server isn't starting. What should I do?

Do the following:

* Use sudo to switch to the root context.
* If the server starts correctly, the problem is the server is running as an unprivileged user.
* Log in as that user, and run it in debugging mode. Any errors or warnings will be appear on the monitor.

## Why is the server is sending an Access-Reject message when the user should be accepted. 

Do the following to gather enough information to diagnose the problem:

* Run the server in debugging mode and observe what happens when the user logs in. 
* If the control socket is configured, run `raddebug -u USERNAME` to gather the same information from a running server.

## The server is sending Access-Accept packets with some attributes, but the user is not getting the correct kind of service (or is getting rejected). Why?

Check the NAS logs to determine why the NAS is ignoring instructions from the server. The NAS documentation outlines the attributes it needs to provide certain services. These attributes can sometimes
be in unusual formats, so be sure to consult the NAS documentation.

##The accounting logs do not contain the information I want to see. How can I make the server log the correct information?

A FreeRADIUS server can only log the information it receives. If the information isn't in the accounting packets, then it wasn’t sent by the NAS.

## How can I restrict a users network access after authentication?

Configure FreeRADIUS to send the appropriate filtering rules to the NAS. The NAS enforces these rules
after authentication. Consult the NAS documentation for the names and format of the attributes. There
are no accepted standards for these attributes, so be sure to consult the NAS documentation.

## How can I configure a captive portal for users?

Consult the NAS documentation on how to configure a captive portal. Each NAS requires different action.
Another option is to use an Open Source captive portal solution. FreeRADIUS only provides a Yes or No
response to authentication requests. FreeRADIUS does not act as a firewall to block network access and
does not support HTTP.

## How can I disconnect a user after they have logged in?

See the NAS documentation. If the specific NAS supports Disconnect-Request, you can use radclient
to send that packet. If the NAS doesn't support the Disconnect-Request, take the appropriate action specific to that particular
NAS. Some NASs support SNMP writes, while other NASs require the administrator to log into the NAS
console and forcibly reset the port. Refer to the specific NAS documentation for more details.

## The server logs have many numerous messages about request timeout or blocked child. How can I fix this?

These blockages generally occur because the server is using a database for authentication that is inactive
or slow. To solve this problem, increase the database’s response speed. As a rough guideline, if a query
takes more than a second, something is catastrophically wrong with the database. Possible solutions
include:

* Add more indexes
* Adg more RAM
* Make sure that other systems are not accessing the database when FreeRADIUS needs to use it

## How many authentications per second can the server handle?

This is largely dependent on the CPU power of the host system, the type of database, and the authenti-
cation protocol. Typically, a new server with all users in memory and PAP authentication can do  tens of thousands of authentications per second.
When using PEAP, the system can be CPU bound and may only do thousands of authentications per second. 

If the users are stored in a database, FreeRADIUS is limited to the speed of the database. For
example, a database that performs a thousand queries per second limits FreeRADIUS to the same number.

## How many accounting packets per second can the server handle?
The host system’s CPU power and database determines how many accounting packets the server can
handle per second. If the database is limited to a thousand writes per second, the FreeRADIUS accounting
requests is also limited to a thousand writes per second.

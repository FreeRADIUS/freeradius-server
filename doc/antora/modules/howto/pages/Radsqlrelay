NAME
       radsqlrelay - relay SQL queries to a central database server


SYNOPSIS
       radsqlrelay [-d sql_driver] [-b database] [-f file] [-h host] [-u user]
       [-p password] [-1] file_path


DESCRIPTION
       radsqlrelay tails a SQL logfile and forwards the queries to a  database
       server. Used to replicate accounting records to one (central) database,
       even if the database has extended downtime.

       The SQL logfile is created by the rlm_sql_log module. The  module  must
       be configured in the radiusd server before you can use radsqlrelay.

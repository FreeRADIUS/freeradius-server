== NetworkManager

NetworkManager is a software utility aimed at simplifying the use of computer networks on Linux and other Unix-like operating systems.

The project was initiated in 2004 by Red Hat, with the goal of enabling Linux users to more easily deal with modern networking needs, particularly Wireless LAN.  NetworkManager takes an opportunistic approach to network selection, attempting to use the best available connection as outages occur, or the user roams between wireless networks.  Ethernet connections are preferred over "known" wireless networks, which are preferred over wireless networks with SSIDs the user has never connected to.  The user is prompted for WEP or WPA keys as needed.

==wpa_supplicant==

[http://hostap.epitest.fi/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant] is an Open Source WPA Supplicant for Linux, BSD, and Windows with support for WPA and WPA2 (IEEE 802.11i / RSN). It is suitable for both desktop/laptop computers and embedded systems. Supplicant is the IEEE 802.1X/WPA component that is used in the client stations. It implements key negotiation with a WPA Authenticator and it controls the roaming and IEEE 802.11 authentication/association of the wlan driver.

==Xsupplicant==

The [http://open1x.sourceforge.net/ Open1X project] is dedicated to bringing a free, open source 802.1X/WPA/WPA2/IEEE802.11i implementation to as many target platforms as possible.

# Logging in an eduroam environment

Running an eduroam service will generally mean there is a
requirement for logging the users of the service. National
education networks will also likely require that logs are kept of
who is using the network. This means that logs must be kept of
both authentication and accounting requests (and likely DHCP as
well).

The easiest and most basic method of log keeping will be to
record, in some form or another, every packet that is received or
sent by the server. This is what is done by the basic [eduroam
guide](/guide/eduroam) and, while fulfilling the requirements, is
not necessarily the most efficient.

EAP has many round trips, and keeping a record of all of these
packets is generally unnecessary. However it is also not
acceptable to just record Access-Accept or Access-Reject packets
and their contents. They will generally not include attributes
such as Calling-Station-Id, and will also not log authentication
attempts that do not fully complete.

Therefore at least the following should be logged, each with an
accurate timestamp:

* Initial authentication request, with
** User-Name (outer)
** Calling-Station-Id
** NAS-IP-Address

* When sending an Access-Accept reply
** Packet-Type ("Accept")
** User-Name (outer)
** User-Name (inner)
** Calling-Station-Id
** Operator-Name
** Chargeable-User-Identity
** NAS-IP-Address

* When sending an Access-Reject reply
** Packet-Type ("Reject")
** Reason for rejection (Module-Failure-Message)
** User-Name (outer)
** User-Name (inner)
** Calling-Station-Id
** Operator-Name
** Chargeable-User-Identity
** NAS-IP-Address


## Logging the initial EAP request

The `session-state.` list can be used to determine whether the
incoming request is the first in an EAP transaction, as on the
first packet the list will be empty. Update the list at the same
time to ensure that it is not empty on the next round; we can use
Tmp-String-1 to note the type of log record.

Make these changes in the default server (`sites-enabled/default`).

    authorize {
        if (!session-state.) {
            update session-state {
                Tmp-String-1 := "request"
            }
            linelog
        }
        ...
    }


## Recording the inner User-Name

To log the inner User-Name, it needs to be copied from the
inner-tunnel to the outer. In `sites-enabled/inner-tunnel`,
update `post-auth`:

    server inner-tunnel {
        post-auth {
            ...
            update outer.session-state {
                User-Name := User-Name
            }

            Post-Auth-Type REJECT {
                ...
                update outer.session-state {
                    User-Name := User-Name
                }
            }
        }
    }


## Logging Accept or Reject

Once again in the outer server, update the `post-auth` section to
log the reply with the required attributes.

    server default {
        post-auth {
            ...
            update session-state {
                Tmp-String-1 := "accept"
            }
            linelog

            Post-Auth-Type REJECT {
                ...
                update session-state {
                    Tmp-String-1 := "reject"
                }
                linelog
            }
        }
    }


## Configure logging

The examples above use the linelog module as an example, but in
reality many different logging methods could be used in the same
place. An example linelog configuration could be something like

    linelog {
        filename = /path/to/log/file
        permissions = 0600
        reference = "messages.%{session-state.Tmp-String-1}"
        messages {
            request = "%T request %{User-Name} %{Calling-Station-Id} ..."
            accept = "%T accept %{User-Name} %{session-state.User-Name} %{Calling-Station-Id} ..."
            reject = "%T reject %{User-Name} %{session-state.User-Name} %{Calling-Station-Id} ..."
        }
    }

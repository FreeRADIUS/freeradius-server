= Install Winbind

To integrate linux-based systems with a Windows Active Directory domain, you need to install Winbind.

== Build winbind from packages

*Debian or Ubuntu*

`apt-get install -y samba winbind krb5-user`

*RHEL or Rocky or Linux based systems*

`yum install -y samba-winbind krb5-workstation`

== Restart the winbind service

  `systemctl stop winbind`
  `systemctl start winbind`

A description of how to test and troubleshoot winbind is provided in the
[Troubleshooting guide].

= DHCP Server

This guide describes how FreeRADIUS can be used in place of ISC DHCP or ISC Kea
to provide a significantly more performant and flexible DHCP server.

The suggested configuration is likely familiar to anyone whoâ€™s used DHCP with common features of other DHCP server software.

The modular design of FreeRADIUS means that there is no one "right" way to
implement the DHCP service. FreeRADIUS allows you to put together a "mix and
match" approach.

For example you can manage the leases in an SQL database. You might then hard
code certain DHCP reply parameters within configuration and then look up
additional parameters using a datastore such as:

  * a local file such as a structured text file or an SQLite database
  * an organizational LDAP directory
  * an SQL or "no SQL" database
  * a remote endpoint such as a RESTful HTTP API

The policy language and modular configuration of FreeRADIUS is sufficiently
powerful and that almost any aspect of the server's behaviour can be customized
to implement even the most sophisticated DHCP configurations.

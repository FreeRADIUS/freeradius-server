= Configure Network-Specific Options and IP Pool Selection

In an environment where multiple networks (often VLANs) are in use, it is
necessary to identify which network a client belongs to in order to assign an
address from the correct pool.

Consider the ISC DHCP configuration snippet:

[source,iscdhcp]
----
option domain-name "example.org";

subnet 10.10.0.0 netmask 255.255.0.0 {
    range 10.10.1.10 10.10.10.254;
    range 10.10.100.10 10.10.110.254;
    option routers 10.10.0.1;
    option domain-name-servers 10.10.0.2, 10.10.0.3;
    default-lease-time 7200;
}
----

Or the equivalent Kea configuration:

[source,isckea]
----
"Dhcp4": {
    "option-data": [
        { "name": "domain-name", "data": "example.org" }
    ],
    "subnet4": [{
        "subnet": "10.10.0.0/16",
        "pools": [ { "pool": "10.10.1.10 - 10.10.10.254" },
                   { "pool": "10.10.100.10 - 10.10.110.254" }
        ],
        "option-data": [
            { "name": "routers", "data": "10.10.0.1" },
            { "name": "domain-name-servers", "data": "10.10.0.2, 10.10.0.3" }
        ],
        "valid-lifetime": 7200
    }],
    ...
}
----

These define a network consisting of a single subnet 10.10.0.0/16 containing two
IP address pools 10.10.1.10 - 10.10.10.254 and 10.10.100.10 - 10.10.110.254.
Requests that are determined to have originated from this network (e.g. because
their `giaddr` belongs within the subnet) will be assigned the specified DHCP
parameters and allocated an address from one of its ranges.

To provide equivalent functionality, FreeRADIUS must identify the correct DHCP
reply parameters as well as the name of the pool to be used for IP address
assignment, based on the originating network of the request.

The definition for this pool (the addresses contained within it, corresponding
to the `range` statement in ISC DHCP and Kea) is specified entirely in the
database: It is precisely the rows in the `dhcpippool` table with a particular
`pool_name`.

[TIP]
====
As described previously, in FreeRADIUS a pool is a set of IP addresses that are
equally valid with respect to the network policy; therefore, unlike ISC DHCP
and ISC Kea, FreeRADIUS does not differentiate between the two `range`s.
Instead we should have previously populated a single pool containing all of the
IP addresses from both ranges.
====

FreeRADIUS derives a request attribute called `Network-Subnet` which
honours the standard DHCP process for designating the choice of network, in
order of preference:

  1. Link Selection Suboption of Option 82
  2. IPv4 Subnet Selection Option
  3. Gateway IP Address ("giaddr")
  4. Client IP Address ("ciaddr", only set for unicast packets)

If `Network-Subnet` contains an IP address then this should be used as
the basis of choosing a network.  When there is no address in this attribute it
can be assumed that the packet has been received from a client on the local
LAN.

The `files` module in FreeRADIUS provides a simple method to map
`Network-Subnet` to the corresponding pool based on its network
membership, setting the appropriate options to return to clients.  It can also
set the global options.

[TIP]
====
In the case where an instance of the `files` module is used to get global
default parameters, the `dhcp_common` policy becomes redundant so the
statement calling the policy (by name) can be commented out in
`<raddb>/sites-enabled/dhcp`.
====

To use an instance of `files` to map `Network-Subnet` to reply options
and the pool name create `<raddb>/mods-enabled/dhcp_subnet` containing

[source,config]
----
files dhcp_subnet {
	key = Network-Subnet
	filename = ${modconfdir}/files/dhcp_subnet
}
----

Then create `<raddb>/mods-config/files/dhcp_subnet` with the mapping between
subnets and options.

For the configuration above you may deduce the following configuration, which
has been extended to include an initial default section for requests originating
from directly-connected clients on the local LAN (192.168.20/24):

[source,config]
----
DEFAULT IP-Pool.Name := "local"
        Domain-Name := "example.org",
        Subnet-Mask := 255.255.255.0,
        Router-Address := 192.168.20.1,
        Domain-Name-Server := 192.168.20.2,
        Fall-Through := yes

10.10.0.0/16 IP-Pool.Name := "remote"
        Subnet-Mask := 255.0.0.0,
        Router-Address := 10.10.0.1,
        Domain-Name-Server := 10.10.0.2,
        Domain-Name-Server += 10.10.0.3,
        IP-Address-Lease-Time := 7200
----

Each block in the file starts with a line beginning with the key to be matched.
In this case the subnet which Network-Subnet will be matched into.  When the
attribute being used as a key is an IPv4 prefix (as with `Network-Subnet`)
then the matching is done using a closest containing matches.  So, in this
case, if `Network-Subnet` contains `10.10.3.5/32` it will match the entry with
the key value `10.10.0.0/16`.

There may be further filtering of the candidates in the form of `<Attribute>
<op> <Value>`.

Following the filters on the first line, attributes in the `control` list can
be set using the syntax of `<Attribute> := <Value>`.  In this example this is
used to specify the `Pool-Name` for choosing the appropriate IP pool to
allocate an address from.

Subsequent indented lines are attribute assignments for values in the `reply`
list.  Note that, apart from the last line, they are all terminated with a
comma.

The special option `Fall-Through` determines whether, following a match,
other records are checked for a match.  All lookups will match the entry
with a key of `DEFAULT` and no further filtering, so `Fall-Through`
is set on that record in order that the other records will be tested
to find subnet matches.

== Example packet processing

For our example, we consider a request arriving from a DHCP relay within
10.10.0.0/16. In the absence of any specific DHCP subnet selection options in
the request, the `Network-Subnet` attribute is calculated to be the
relay's IP address, say 10.10.0.1.

The request is matched against the first block, setting an initial pool name to
"local", domain name to "example.org" and setting some additional global
default parameters. By virtue of `Fall-Through` being set, the next block is
considered.

Since the network identifier is within the specified subnet (i.e.  `10.10.0.1 <
10.10.0.0/16`) this second block is matched. This block overrides the pool name
setting it to "remote", overrides some other global defaults and sets the lease
time to 7200 seconds. `Fall-Through` is not set, so we are now done with
deriving the pool name and network options.

When the `sqlippool` module is called during `recv Discover` processing (in
`<raddb>/sites-enabled/dhcp`) the `remote` pool will be used for IP address
allocation.

The assigned IP address and network parameters will subsequently be returned in
the DHCP reply.

== Testing the pool operation and network-specific options

Before proceeding further, you should test the operation of the IP pools and
ensure that any network-specific reply attributes that you have configured are
correctly set in replies.

For example, if you have a single, flat pool you should test using sample
packets for devices with different MAC addresses and/or Client Identifiers.

[source,shell]
----
cat <<EOF > dhcp-packet-1.txt
Message-Type := Discover
Client-Hardware-Address := 02:01:11:11:11:11
Client-Identifier := device1
EOF
----

[source,shell]
----
cat <<EOF > dhcp-packet-2.txt
Message-Type := Discover
Client-Hardware-Address := 02:01:22:22:22:22
Client-Identifier := device2
EOF
----

Generate these packets as show previously using the dhcpclient tool and look
for `Your-IP-Address` in the DHCP responses to determine the IP address
that has been offered.

Ensure that the DHCP Offer responses contain unique IP addresses. Ensure that
when these requests are resent within the lifetime of the initial offer that
the reponses to the subsequent replies contain the original IP address that was
in the initial offer to the device.

Additionally, ensure that the DHCP Offers contain any network-specific
parameters that you have specified.

In the case that the policy contains multiple IP pools and network definitions
for clients belonging to different Layer 2 networks (or indeed belonging to the
same network but segregated according to some local policy) you should ensure
that the devices are being mapped to the correct definition.

For a typical policy that selects the IP pool and network options based on the
originating network for the DHCP packet, explicitly specifying a network by
including a `DHCP-Subnet-Selection-Option` parameter may avoid the need to test
from a host within each individual network:

[source,shell]
----
cat <<EOF > dhcp-packet-network-10.10.10.0.txt
Message-Type := Discover
Client-Hardware-Address := 02:01:aa:bb:cc:dd
Client-Identifier := abc123
Subnet-Selection-Option := 10.10.10.0
EOF
----

For policies where the IP pool and network option selection is based on some
custom criteria it is necessary to include different variations for the
parameters on which the policy makes the decision. The testing example for the
class-specific options later in this document provides such an example.

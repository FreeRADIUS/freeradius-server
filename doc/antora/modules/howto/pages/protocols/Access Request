##Description

Access-Request is defined in RFC 2865.

Access-Request packets are sent to a RADIUS server, and convey information used to determine whether a user is allowed access to a specific NAS, and any special services requested for that user. An implementation wishing to authenticate a user MUST transmit a RADIUS packet with the Code field set to 1 (Access-Request).

Upon receipt of an Access-Request from a valid client, an appropriate reply MUST be transmitted.

An Access-Request SHOULD contain a [[User-Name]] attribute.  It MUST contain either a NAS-IP-Address attribute or a NAS-Identifier attribute (or both).

An Access-Request MUST contain either a User-Password or a CHAP-Password or a State.  An Access-Request MUST NOT contain both a User-Password and a CHAP-Password.  If future extensions allow other kinds of authentication information to be conveyed, the attribute for that can be used in an Access-Request instead of User-Password or CHAP-Password.

An Access-Request SHOULD contain a NAS-Port or NAS-Port-Type attribute or both unless the type of access being requested does not involve a port or the NAS does not distinguish among its ports.

An Access-Request MAY contain additional attributes as a hint to the server, but the server is not required to honor the hint.

When a User-Password is present, it is hidden using a method based on the RSA Message Digest Algorithm MD5.

A summary of the Access-Request packet format is shown below. The fields are transmitted from left to right.

##Code

1 for Access-Request.

##Identifier

The Identifier field MUST be changed whenever the content of the Attributes field changes, and whenever a valid reply has been received for a previous request.  For retransmissions, the Identifier MUST remain unchanged.

##Request Authenticator

The Request Authenticator value MUST be changed each time a new Identifier is used.

##Attributes

The Attribute field is variable in length, and contains the list of Attributes that are required for the type of service, as well as any desired optional Attributes.

= Tools

FreeRADIUS comes with a set of useful tools that assist you in
monitoring and collecting statistics for your system.  While there are
many third-party tools that offer similar functionality, the reliable
and proven tools included with FreeRADIUS are the ones we recommend using.

Each tool has a specific purpose and is designed to work seamlessly
together. These tools include:

== xref:optimization/tools/radclient.adoc[radclient]

Radclient enables you to set up mock clients to perform basic
authentication testing.  It takes an input file which defines which
attributes and values are included in the packet.

== xref:optimization/tools/radmin.adoc[radmin]

Radmin is an administration tool designed to administer and interact
with a running FreeRADIUS server. It enables administrators to monitor
statistics, view configurations, and make changes without the need to
restart the server. Radmin connects to the control socket of a running
server, providing a command-line interface to manage it.

== xref:optimization/tools/radsniff.adoc[radsniff]

Radsniff allows you to inspect and process any type of RADIUS packet
that's on the network. This tool can be used in conjunction with
`radclient`.

== xref:optimization/tools/raduat.adoc[raduat]

Raduat is uses `radclient` to send packets to the server, and then
validate the responses from the server.  It should be used as part of
a test suite to ensure that changes to the server configuration do not
affect the flow of requests and responses, or even the content of the
responses.

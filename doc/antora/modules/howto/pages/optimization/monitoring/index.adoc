= Monitoring

Any good systems administrator will want to know how well
their systems are operating, both to catch issues before they
become a serious problem, or for long term analysis.

The term "monitoring" can encompass all kinds of watching how the
system is working, from generating and watching logs, gathering
statistics or ensuring that the service daemon is still running
and serving requests.

Monitoring is organized into the following sections:

== Service checking

Checking the running service can include the following:

* Ensuring the daemon is still running, i.e. process monitoring.
* Sending regular RADIUS authentication or accounting requests and checking they are correctly responded to.
* Sending Status-Server RADIUS requests.

Within a proxy environment FreeRADIUS needs to know if upstream
proxies are available. It can do this itself by issuing request as outlined in the options above.

== Logging

System logs are often the most critical part of a RADIUS system.
Logs are necessary for the administrator to know who has logged in
and when, for debugging purposes such as when an end user cannot
connect, and often for regulatory or compliance purposes.

FreeRADIUS server logs are also often used as a basic form of
recording accounting requests, which are also a
form of logging by the NAS. Getting correct logging systems
operational is key to running an efficient and easy to maintain
FreeRADIUS server.

FreeRADIUS has many options for being able to generate and store
logs, including the following:

* Main daemon logging, configured in xref:reference:raddb/radiusd.conf.adoc[`radiusd.conf`].
* Line-based text logging, using xref:reference:raddb/mods-available/linelog.adoc[`rlm_linelog`].
* Detailed RADIUS packet logs, using xref:reference:raddb/mods-available/detail.adoc[`rlm_detail`].

As well as recording direct to disk, the options above can be sent via a
local syslog server, which opens up many opportunities for central
logging.

It is possible to integrate FreeRADIUS into other more complicated
logging systems, some options may include:

* To CSV files, for example via xref:reference:raddb/mods-available/linelog.adoc[`rlm_linelog`].
* Writing entries to an SQL database using xref:reference:raddb/mods-available/sql.adoc[`rlm_sql`].
* Into a log management system such as Elasticsearch or Graylog.


== Statistics gathering

It is often useful to collect statistics from a running RADIUS
server. The data collected can be displayed on graphs to show current load or
for trend analysis, as well as an indication of system operation.

Statistics are usually gathered in two ways:

* FreeRADIUS xref:optimization/monitoring/statistics.adoc[internal statistics].
* Analyzing logs with some external tool.

= Configuration Files

FreeRADIUS 4 organizes its configuration files in a specific directory structure, typically within /etc/freeradius/ (on Debian-based systems) or /etc/raddb/. The files are text-based and loaded once when the server starts; changes require a server restart to take effect. The files are text-based and include extensive comments to explain their purpose and usage.

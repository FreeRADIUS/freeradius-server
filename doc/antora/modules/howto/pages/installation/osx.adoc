= Building on OSX

FreeRADIUS can be installed on OSX platforms, however some environment setup is required. Additional dev tools are also configured before the server installation.

== Hard Dependencies

=== Homebrew

Install the https://brew.sh[Homebrew] package manager to streamline the installation process on OSX platforms. It'll make your life on macOS far simpler. Once you've installed Homebrew, you can install more from the command line:

```bash
brew install talloc
```
=== Install Script

Run the `install_deps.sh` script to install the build dependencies. It's recommended to create a copy of this file and edit locally. You can remove apps, libs, or utilites that you don't need such as postgresql. Ensure that you use the updated file when running the script.

=== Xcode Tools

Install Xcode from the https://www.apple.com/ca/app-store/[app store]. This tool is used to help develop, test, and manage your applications.

Install the xcode command-line tools.

```
xcode-select --install
```

Update the `~/.zshrc` file.

```
cat scripts/osx/bash_profile >> ~/.zshrc
```
[NOTE]
====
If using a different shell, ensure you copy the environment paramenters to your current shell.

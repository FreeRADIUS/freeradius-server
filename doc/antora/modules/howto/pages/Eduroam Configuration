# A very basic (but functional) eduroam configuration

## Overview

This guide is intended to help any site wishing to join eduroam implement the IdP (home service) and SP (visited service) eduroam components.  It contains sample configuration files that may be used in place of the normal v3.0.x configuration files that ship with the server.

In addition to the configuration files here, you will need to configure a module to talk to your user store (LDAP, Novell, Active Directory, SQL).  See notes in the inner-tunnel configuration.

The general order of operations is:

1. Install FreeRADIUS >= 3.0.15 from packages or by building from source.
2. Replace the relevant configuration files in ``/etc/raddb`` or ``/etc/freeradius`` with the ones found here.
3. Start the server with ``radiusd -X || freeradius -X``
4. Use the test files with ``eapol_test`` to verify the server is functional.
5. Stop the server.
6. Remove the call to the ``files`` module in the inner-tunnel, and either configure ``ntlm_auth``, the ldap module, or the sql module.
7. Modify the ``eapol_test`` files with real credentials in your user directory (preferably a test account).
8. Start the server with ``radiusd -X || freeradius -X``
9. Check that the ``eapol_test`` files work with *REAL* credentials.
10. Stop the server.
11. Replace the dummy certs in the ``certs`` directory (``/etc/raddb/certs`` or ``/etc/freeradius/certs/``) with ones issued by [edupki](https://www.edupki.org) or a commerical certification authority.
12. Alter the ``eapol_test`` files so they specify a certification authority.
13. Check that the ``eapol_test`` files work with a *REAL* certificate, and *REAL* credentials.
14. Clone the config onto two servers (or clone the server).
15. Pass the server IP addresses of those servers to your NRO (National RADIUS Operator).  They will usually issue you secrets and tell you the IP addresses of the FLRS (Federation Level RADIUS Servers), which you need to put in ``proxy.conf`` and ``clients.conf``

A separate page gives more detail on configuring efficient logging for eduroam.

## Tooling

### eapol_test

Before you begin you should build a copy of ``eapol_test``.  ``eapol_test`` is an extremely useful tool produced by the hostapd project which can simulate both a Wireless Access Point and a Supplicant (client).  Unfortunately it's not usually packaged and can be quite challenging to build manually.

A script is included in the FreeRADIUS CIT suite that will automatically build ``eapol_test``, which you should use. Instructions on building it are as follows:

#### Dependencies

##### Centos/RHEL

----
sudo yum groupinstall "Development Tools"
sudo yum install git openssl-devel pkgconfig libnl3-devel
----

##### Ubuntu/Debian

----
sudo apt-get install git libssl-dev devscripts pkg-config libnl-3-dev libnl-genl-3-dev
----

#### Building

----
git clone --depth 1 --no-single-branch https://github.com/FreeRADIUS/freeradius-server.git

cd freeradius-server/scripts/ci/

./eapol_test-build.sh

cp ./eapol_test/eapol_test /usr/local/bin/
----

You should now have a functional ``eapol_test`` in your path.

## Configuration

You should replace existing configuration files in their entirety with the configuration file contents provided below.

### The outer virtual server

This is a bare bones configuration file for the outer virtual-server.  This virtual-server handles
the outer EAP conversation, i.e. data outside of the TLS tunnel.

It does the following:
- Checks the sanity of incoming ``User-Name`` strings.
- Routes requests that cannot be processed locally to the NRO (National Roaming Operator).
- Filters responses from remote IdPs.
- Calls the EAP module for authentication of local users.
- Assigns a VLAN based on whether the user is a local user, or was authenticated by a remote IdP.
- Logs authentication successes and failures.

***

All eduroam members should log requests to/from their servers for compliance purposes and because it makes debugging much easier.

These logging module instances and the virtual server configuration above will make your site fully compliant, so long as the syslog messages are retained for the requisite period.

We recommend ingesting the messages into logstash or Splunk to make debugging/helpdesk activities easier.

***

#### ``mods-available/linelog``

----
linelog linelog_recv_request {
	filename = syslog
	syslog_facility = local0
	syslog_severity = debug
	format = "action = Recv-Request, %{pairs:request:}"
}

	filename = syslog
	syslog_facility = local0

	format = "action = Send-Accept, %{pairs:request:}"
}

	filename = syslog
	syslog_facility = local0
	syslog_severity = debug
	format = "action = Send-Reject, %{pairs:request:}"
}

linelog linelog_send_proxy_request {
	filename = syslog
	syslog_facility = local0
	syslog_severity = debug
	format = "action = Send-Proxy-Request, %{pairs:proxy-request:}"
}

linelog linelog_recv_proxy_response {
	filename = syslog
	syslog_facility = local0
	syslog_severity = debug
	reference = "messages.%{proxy-reply:Response-Packet-Type}"
	messages {
		Access-Accept = "action = Recv-Proxy-Accept, User-Name = %{User-Name}, Calling-Station-Id = %{Calling-Station-Id}, %{pairs:proxy-reply:}"
		Access-Reject = "action = Recv-Proxy-Reject, User-Name = %{User-Name}, Calling-Station-Id = %{Calling-Station-Id}, %{pairs:proxy-reply:}"
		Access-Challenge = "action = Recv-Proxy-Challenge, User-Name = %{User-Name}, Calling-Station-ID = %{Calling-Station-Id}, %{pairs:proxy-reply:}"
	}
}

----

You will also need to configure your local syslog deaemon to log these messages.

For rsyslogd you could do that with the following:

----
echo "local0.debug					/var/log/radius_auth.log" > /etc/rsyslog.d/radiusd.conf
----

Then setup the appropriate log rotation rules.

        ipaddr = <ip-address>
        secret = <secret>
        status_check = status-server

#	home_server = eduroam_flr_server_2
}
realm eduroam_flr {
        auth_pool = eduroam_flr_pool
	nostrip
}
----

***

The ``clients.conf`` file determines which devices can talk to the RADIUS server.

In most instances we need:
- An entry for localhost (testing).
- An entry for each of the FLRS.
- An entry for the management subnet of your WLCs/Access points.

***

#### ``clients.conf``

----
client localhost {
	ipaddr = 127.0.0.1
	secret = testing123
}

client eduroam_flr_server_1 {
        ipaddr = <ip-address>
        secret = <secret>
	nastype = 'eduroam_flr'
}

# As above, only uncomment if there are two federation level servers
#client eduroam_flr_server_2 {
#       ipaddr = <ip-address>

### The Inner virtual Server

This is a bare bones configuration file for the outer virtual-server.  This virtual-server handles
the inner EAP conversation, i.e. data inside of the TLS tunnel.

It does the following:
- Checks the sanity of the inner identity.
- Makes the inner identity available to the outer server.
- Retrieve's the users password/forwards credentials to ActiveDirectory (if used).
- Authenticates the user.

NOTE: You may need to symlink ``mods-enabled/inner-eap`` to ``mods-available/inner-eap``. i.e. ``cd /etc/raddb/mods-available; ln -s ../mods-available/inner-eap ../mods-enabled/inner-eap``.

	listen {
		type = auth
		ipaddr = *
		port = 18120 # Used for testing only.  Requests proxied internally.
	}

		# The outer username is considered garabage for autz purposes, but 
		# the domain portion of the outer and inner identities must match.

		# THIS IS SITE SPECIFIC
		#
		# The files module is *ONLY* used for testing.  It lets you define 
		# credentials in a flat file, IT WILL NOT SCALE.
		#
		# - If you use OpenLDAP with salted password hashes you should 
 		#   call the 'ldap' module here and use EAP-TTLS-PAP as your EAP method.
		# - If you use OpenLDAP with cleartext passwords you should 
		#   call the 'ldap' module here and use EAP-TTLS or PEAPv0.
		# - If you use an SQL DB with salted password hashes you should call 
		#   the 'sql' module here and use EAP-TTLS-PAP as your EAP method.
		# - If you use an SQL DB with cleartext passwords you should call 
		#   the 'sql' module here and use EAP-TTLS or PEAPv0.
		# - If you use Novell you should call the 'ldap' module here and 
		#   set ``edir = yes`` in ``mods-available/ldap`` and use EAP-TTLS or
		#   PEAPv0.
		# - If you use Active Directory, you don't need anything here (remove 
		#   the call to files) but you'll need to follow this 
		#   [guide](freeradius-active-directory-integration-howto) and use 
		#   EAP-TTLS-PAP or PEAPv0.
		# - If you're using EAP-TLS (i'm impressed!) remove the call to files.
		#
		# EAP-TTLS-PAP and PEAPv0 are equally secure/insecure depending on how the 
		# supplicant is configured. PEAPv0 has a slight edge in that you need to 
		# crack MSCHAPv2 to get the user's password (but this is not hard).

## Testing

``eapol_test`` is the utility of choice when testing. Some basic config files for ``eapol_test`` are given below, which allow you to generate EAP-TTLS, EAP-PEAP and EAP-TLS requests.

### Test files

***
This testing entry for the files module set the 'known-good' or 'reference' password to be 'changeme' for all users.

The ``files`` module should be removed from the config before the server is placed into production.

= NAS-Port

NAS-Port is one of the basic RADIUS attributes.

== NAS-Port meaning per Vendor

This section was populated by knowledge accumulated while trying to support various vendor's equipment in 802.1X / MAC-Authentication in the PacketFence open-source Network Access Control

Refer to PacketFence's source code for the most accurate values.

=== Wired switches

NAS-Port to ifIndex conversions

==== 3Com

The below worked for the Switch 4200G, E4800G and E5500G. They are now branded as HP's.

Here, 4096 NAS-Port slots are reserved per physical port and there is a starting offset of 16781312.

dot1dPort = ceil ( (NAS-Port - 16781312) / 4096 )

dot1dPort is convertible into ifIndex using SNMP (A3COM-HUAWEI-LswINF-MIB::hwifXXBasePortIndex or 1.3.6.1.4.1.43.45.1.2.23.1.1.1.1.10)

Ex: 16855041 is ifIndex 4227289 (dot1dPort 19)

==== Cisco 2950 and derivatives

IfIndex = NAS-Port - 50000

Ex: 50017 is ifIndex 17

==== Cisco 2960 and derivatives

IfIndex = NAS-Port - 40000

Ex: 50023 is ifIndex 10023

==== Juniper

NAS-Port's number is the ifIndex index.

Ex: NAS-Port 115 is the 115th ifIndex entry  which is ifIndex 598.

=== Wireless controllers or access points

NAS-Port values have not proven meaningful or useful on Wireless equipment. Management type tasks are often performed using an end-point's MAC address instead of a virtual port id.

= LetsEncrypt

When configuring FreeRADIUS to use EAP, the use of keys and
certificates are essential. Unfortunately this is one of those areas
that can be hard to get right and prone to problems.  Notably,
certificates can expire at very inopportune moments.  At which point
no one can get online.

Our recommendation is always to use a private CA for both server
and user certificates for utmost security. However, the problem of
having to install the CA root certificate on all end user devices
can put many people off of this route. In that case, using a public CA
certificate for the server is often seen as the most convenient
answer, even if it is not the most secure.

[WARNING]
====
Never configure FreeRADIUS to use a public CA root in the
`ca_file` or `ca_path` EAP module settings. This would potentially
allow any secondary (intermediate) CA signed by that public CA to
issue client certificates, and be authenticated by your server!
====

== Prerequisites

The instructions here depend on the following criteria:

- You have chosen to use a public CA to issue the server
  certificate for your RADIUS server, and are aware of the
  security considerations in doing so.

- You wish to use https://letsencrypt.org/[LetsEncrypt] for this
  purpose, and want certificate renewals (usually every 2-3 months) to
  be automatic.

- The RADIUS server has a public IP address and can receive
  traffic on port 80 for certificate renewals, and you have
  considered the security implications of this.

- There is a DNS entry pointing at the server that the certificate
  can be issued for.

RADIUS servers are usually best hidden away on an internal network, so
the final few points above are worth considering carefully. It is
possible to set this up using a front web-server which requests the
certificate and then pushes it back to the RADIUS server internally,
but that configuration is beyond the scope of this document.


== Set up process

The instructions here use LetsEncrypt's https://certbot.eff.org/[certbot] tool to generate
certificates and renew them when necessary. Other alternative
tools can be used based on the following instructions.

We will be setting up the following components:

- Creating up a group that has access to the certificate files.

- Writing a post-renewal hook script for `certbot` so that FreeRADIUS
  is restarted after the new certificate has been installed.

- Running `certbot` to issue the certificate.

- Configure FreeRADIUS to use the LetsEncrypt issued certificate
  and associated private key.

This document is based on a Debian system (version 12 at the time
of writing), so it may need adjusting for other operating systems.
The instructions here are for a generic system, so it may also need
adjusting for each particular case. For example, a group may
already exist that has ownership of the certificates, so that can
likely be used instead of creating a new one.


=== Initial system configuration

FreeRADIUS should already be installed. We will assume here that
it is running as the `freerad` user, but may be `radiusd` on RPM
based systems, `radius` if installed from source, or some other
user.

[NOTE]
====
You *must* have a public IP address for the server, and
there *must* be a DNS entry (of the name of the certificate you
will be requesting) pointing to this IP. The server *must* be
reachable on port 80 (HTTP) from the Internet.
====

Install the `certbot` utility from LetsEncrypt. On Debian it can
be installed from the default repositories:

[source,shell]
----
apt-get update
apt-get install certbot
----

Add a group for the certificate and key files, and then add the
FreeRADIUS user to this group so that FreeRADIUS can read the
certificate files:

[source,shell]
----
addgroup -s certs
adduser freerad certs
----


=== Configure certbot

We will use a script to restart FreeRADIUS whenever `certbot` renews
the certificate. This script will also ensure that the permissions are
always set correctly on the certificate files, so that FreeRADIUS
is able to read them.

Create a file `/usr/local/sbin/certbot-post-hook` with the following
contents:

[source,shell]
----
#!/bin/sh

#  Ensure certificates are in the correct group
chgrp -R certs /etc/letsencrypt/live /etc/letsencrypt/archive
chmod 750 /etc/letsencrypt/live /etc/letsencrypt/archive

#  Restart FreeRADIUS
/usr/sbin/service freeradius restart
----


=== Generate the certificate

The system is now ready to request a certificate from LetsEncrypt.  We
will be using the example FQDN of `radius.example.com` here; replace
this name with whatever name you have in your DNS, and which points to
the public IP address of the RADIUS server.

First, generate a certificate from the test certificate issuer.  There
are severe rate limits on the production issuer server, which can mean
you are quickly locked out if making multiple requests while testing.
It is therefore useful to try with the test issuer first.

Run the following set of commands to generate a key and to request the certificate.

.Generate a test certificate
[%collapsible]
====
[source,shell]
----
certbot certonly \
        --test-cert \
        --standalone \
        --cert-name radius.example.com \
        -d radius.example.com \
        --post-hook /usr/local/sbin/certbot-post-hook
----
====

[NOTE]
====
The `certbot` opens up a temporary web server on port 80
while this is in progress. Ensure that any firewalls are already
opened up, and that external systems can connect to the machine in
port 80.
====

Any issues generating this certificate pair need to be
investigated and fixed. Repeat the above command as necessary
until the certificate is issued successfully.

[NOTE]
====
There are still rate limits on LetsEncrypt's test server,
but they are higher and you are less likely to hit them than with
the production issuer.
====

Once you have successfully generated a test certificate, you can
remove it and request the real certificate:

.Generate a real certificate
[%collapsible]
====
[source,shell]
----
certbot revoke \
        --test-cert \
        --standalone \
        --delete-after-revoke \
        --cert-name radius.example.com

certbot certonly \
        --standalone \
        --cert-name radius.example.com \
        -d radius.example.com \
        --post-hook /usr/local/sbin/certbot-post-hook
----
====

=== FreeRADIUS configuration

The last step is to configure FreeRADIUS to use the new
LetsEncrypt certificates. In the default configuration this is in
the `/etc/freeradius/mods-enabled/eap` file.

Find the `tls-config tls-common` section. The default will have:

----
certificate_file = ${certdir}/rsa/server.pem
private_key_file = ${certdir}/rsa/server.key
----

Change these entries to point to the new certificate and key:

----
certificate_file = /etc/letsencrypt/live/radius.example.com/fullchain.pem
private_key_file = /etc/letsencrypt/live/radius.example.com/privkey.pem
----

Test the FreeRADIUS configuration with the following command:

[source,shell]
----
radiusd -XC
----

If all is well then the server will print the following message:

[source,log]
----
Configuration appears to be OK
----

Finally restart FreeRADIUS to use the new LetsEncrypt
certificate:

[source,shell]
----
service freeradius restart
----


=== Check certificate renewal process

The certificates need to be renewed before three months is up.
There is a command, `certbot renew`, to do this automatically. On
Debian based systems, the `certbot` package will create a cron job
or systemd timer to run this at least daily, but you should still check that this
cron job is enabled.


== Troubleshooting

There are a number of issues that may occur. We list some here
that may help.

=== Certificate won't issue

- Can the RADIUS server be reached from the Internet to tcp port
  80? Is there a firewall or similar blocking access?

- Is there a DNS entry, for the same domain name being requested,
  resolvable in the public DNS?

- Does that DNS entry point to the IP of the system running `certbot`?

- Have you hit the LetsEncrypt rate limits?


=== Certificate expires and does not renew

- Is the server still reachable on port 80, and is the DNS entry
  still present and correct (as above)?

- Is the `certbot` cron job or `systemd` timer to renew certificates
  enabled? The Debian packaging creates these, but other systems
  may not.


=== FreeRADIUS refuses to start

- Check the certificate permissions are set correctly. Can the
  FreeRADIUS user read the certificate and key files?  If there is a
  permissions issue, FreeRADIUS will print out a descriptive error
  message.


### User devices fail to trust the server

- Was the FreeRADIUS daemon restarted after changing the
  configuration?

- Most devices include the LetsEncrypt root these day, but some older
  devices may not. Install the LetsEncrypt root CA certificate on
  those devices if needed.

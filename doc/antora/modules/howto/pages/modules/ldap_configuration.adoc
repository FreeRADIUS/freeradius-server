= Configuring the LDAP module

The xref:raddb:mods-available/ldap.adoc[ldap module] configuration
file describes the configuration parameters accepted by the module,
and what they do.  This document explains how to perform testing with
the LDAP module.

Before configuring the LDAP module, the LDAP parameters should first
be validated via the xref:modules/ldap_search.adoc[`ldapsearch`]
command-line tool.

== Editing mods-available/ldap

As with all FreeRADIUS configuration files, please change at little as
possible in the default configuration.  The defaults are usually close
to being correct.  All that is necessary is to make minor changes, and
_test_ them.  FreeRADIUS should look for data.

If the xref:modules/ldap_search.adoc[`ldapsearch`] tests above pass,
then the LDAP module configuration can be copied directly from the
command-line options to that tool:

[source,shell]
----
ldapsearch -D ${identity} -w ${password} -h ${server} -b 'CN=user,${base_dn}' '${filter}' '*'
----

Where we have the following configuration paramters:

`${identity}`::
The information going into the `identity` configuration item of the LDAP module.
+
This identity should be a read-only, non-administrator account.

`${password}`::
The information going into the `password` configuration item of the LDAP module.

`${server}`::
The information going into the `server` configuration item of the LDAP module.
+
This information could also be taken from the URI in the `-H`
command-line option.  We generally recommend using the URI form
instead of a bare hostname.

`${base_dn}`::
The information going into the `base_dn` configuration item of the LDAP module.
+
This is ususally something like `dc=example,dc=com`

`${filter}`::
The information going into the `filter` configuration item of the LDAP module.
+
The `filter` configuration item is located inside of the `user { ... }` section/

We do _not_ recommend immediately configuring TLS.  The best approach
is to test one piece in isolation, before proceeding on to the next
piece.


== Enabling mods-available/ldap

The `ldap` module is enabled by creating a soft link from the
`mods-enabled/` directory to the `mods-available/` directory.

[source,shell]
----
cd raddb/mods-enabled && ln -s ../mods-available/ldap
----

It is also possible to copy the `mods-available/ldap` default
configuration file to `mods-enabled/ldap`, and then edit that file.
This process leaves the original `mods-available/ldap` configuration
file in place, if there is a need to refer to it in the future.  The
choice of which method to use is up to the local administrator.

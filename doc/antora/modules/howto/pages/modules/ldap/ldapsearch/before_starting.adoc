= Before starting

Try to determine answers to the following questions:

* What's the IP address of the LDAP server being tested?
** If using an FQDN does the FQDN resolve to this IP address?
* Does the LDAP server requires encrypted connections?
** If yes:
*** Does the LDAP server use the StartTLS extension to transition to
encrypted communication, or is communication encrypted from the start (LDAPS)?
*** What are the necessary root certificates and intermediary certificates
needed to validate the identity of the LDAP server?
* What port is used to connect to the LDAP server?  Usually this will be `389`
(unencrypted or StartTLS) or `636` (LDAPS).
* Do connections need to be bound to perform searches on the LDAP directory?
** If yes:
*** Determine what credentials are needed for binding, and whether a client
certificate is required.
* Determine the Base DN, the object deepest in the tree that contains the object
representing users, groups, clients etc...

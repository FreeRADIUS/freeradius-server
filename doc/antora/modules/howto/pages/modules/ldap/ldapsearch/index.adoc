= Mapping and testing with ldapsearch

Every LDAP directory is different.  Each directory has different connection parameters,
locations for objects, and attributes within those objects.

This section of the LDAP howto will guide you through discovering the values
needed to configure the LDAP module.

We _strongly_ recommend running these checks in this section on the same machine
that will be used to host the RADIUS server.  A common cause of connectivity
issues is that a firewall is preventing network access from the RADIUS server to
the LDAP server. Running `ldapsearch` on a third machine may not reveal these
firewall issues.

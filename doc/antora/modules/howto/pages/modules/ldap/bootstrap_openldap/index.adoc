= Installing and Configuring OpenLDAP

This section of the howto describes two methods of creating an OpenLDAP instance for
testing purposes.

== xref:modules/ldap/bootstrap_openldap/docker.adoc[Docker]

If you're looking to create a temporary instance of OpenLDAP and spin it up as
quickly as possible, you should consider using the
https://docs.docker.com/install/[Docker containerisation service].

A pre-configured docker container allow you to create a self-contained OpenLDAP
instance with a minimum amount of effort.

== xref:modules/ldap/bootstrap_openldap/packages.adoc[Packages]

If you're looking to create a more permanent installation of OpenLDAP or
are not comfortable using docker, then you may wish to install OpenLDAP from packages.

OpenLDAP is available pre-packaged for many distributions.  We recommend
using the OpenLDAP LTB packages available under the
"Packaging and OpenLDAP extensions" heading https://ltb-project.org/documentation[here].

= Controlling user accounts

In some instances it may be useful to "lock out" user accounts.

The naïve approach of including subfilters in `user.filter` to prevent
user objects for disabled accounts being return can cause subtle issues.

Using a subfilter, it is not possible to distinguish a login with an incorrect
username from an attempt to use a disabled account (both result in a `notfound`
return code).

Return code ambiguity causes multiple other issues:

- `notfound` does not result in the user being explicitly rejected.
  This may result in spurious logging output or un-needed callouts to
  additional modules.
- It's not possible in policy to detect a login with a disabled account.
  This is a lost opportunity to log useful debugging data.
- It's not possible from FreeRADIUS' log output to detect a login with
  disabled account. This can make debugging frustrating.

== Controlling user access with user.access_attribute and user.access_positive

See xref:modules/ldap/ldapsearch/index.adoc[ldapsearch] for how to determine the
appropriate values for your directory.

The presence of the attribute specified by `user.access_attribute` can indicate the account
is enabled, or disabled, depending on the value of `user.access_positive`.

|===
|                              | Access Attribute present (set true) | Access Attribute present (set false) | Access Attribute absent
| `user.access_positive = yes` | `ok`                                | `locked out`                         | `locked out`
| `user.access_positive = no`  | `locked out`                        | `ok`                                 | `ok`
|===

When a user is "locked out", the LDAP module will return `disallow` in (≥ v4.0.x) and `userlock` in (≤ v3.0.x).

=== Editing mods-available/ldap to only allow access if the 'Access Attribute' is present

[source,config]
----
ldap {
	user {
		# example - dialupAccess
		access_attribute = '<user_access_enabled_attribute>' <1>
		access_positive = yes
	}
}
----

<1> The attribute to use to indicate that the account is enabled.
    If the attribute is absent or set to false then the user will be
    "locked out".

=== Editing mods-available/ldap to disable access if the 'Access Attribute' is present

[source,config]
----
ldap {
	user {
		# example - ms-DS-User-Account-Disabled
		access_attribute = '<user_access_disabled_attribute>' <1>
		access_positive = no
	}
}
----

<1> The attribute to use to indicate that the account is disabled.
    If the attribute is present or set to true then the user will be
    "locked out".

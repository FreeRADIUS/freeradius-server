= Base configuration

The configuration step should be little more than
xref:modules/ldap/ldapsearch/index.adoc#_translating_ldapsearch_arguments_to_rlm_ldap_configuration_items[copying the parameters used by ldapsearch]
to the xref:raddb:mods-available/ldap.adoc[ldap module] configuration file.

The xref:raddb:mods-available/ldap.adoc[ldap module] configuration file
describes the configuration parameters accepted by the module, and what they do.

== Editing mods-available/ldap

As with all FreeRADIUS configuration files, please change at little as
possible in the default configuration.  The defaults are usually close
to being correct.  All that is necessary is to make minor changes, and
_test_ them.  FreeRADIUS should look for data.

If the xref:modules/ldap/ldapsearch/index.adoc[ldapsearch] tests above pass,
then the LDAP module configuration can be copied directly from the
command-line options to that tool using the
xref:modules/ldap/ldapsearch/index.adoc#_translating_ldapsearch_arguments_to_rlm_ldap_configuration_items[translation table] on that page.

At a minimum you will need to set the following configuration items
in in xref:raddb:mods-available/ldap.adoc[mods-available/ldap] using
the values you discovered
running the xref:modules/ldap/ldapsearch/index.adoc[ldapsearch] tests.

[source,config]
----
ldap {
	# example - identity = 'cn=readonly,dc=example,dc=com'
	identity = '<readonly_user_dn>'             <1>

	# example - password = 'readonly'
	password = '<readonly_user_password>'       <2>

	# example - server = ldap://localhost
	server = '<uri>'                            <3>

	# example - base_dn = 'dc=example,dc=com'
	base_dn = '<dn_that_parents_user_objects_and_group_objects>'  <4>

	user {
		# example - base_dn = "ou=people,${..base_dn}"
		base_dn = "<path_from_base_dn_to_user_obj_dn>,${..base_dn}"  <5>

		# example = "(&(uid=%{%{Stripped-User-Name}:-%{User-Name}})(objectClass=posixAccount))"
		filter = "(&(<user_uid_attribute>=%{%{Stripped-User-Name}:-%{User-Name}})(<user_filter>))"  <6>
	}
}

<1> A read only user that can bind to the directory to perform searches.
    This user should not have permission to modify the directory unless
    you're also using LDAP for accounting
    xref:modules/ldap/accounting.adoc[accounting].
<2> The password for the read only user.
<3> An LDAP URI pointing to the server.  If the LDAP server is on the same
    host as the RADIUS server, consider using a Unix Socket (`ldapi://`)
    to reduce network overhead.
<4> The object containing all other objects we're interested in.
<5> The object containing all the users we need to perform AAA functions for.
<6> A filter to select the object matching the authenticating user.

We do _not_ recommend immediately configuring TLS unless you are testing against
a production server.  The best approach is to test one piece in isolation,
before proceeding on to the next piece.

== Enabling mods-available/ldap

The `ldap` module is enabled by creating a soft link from the
`mods-enabled/` directory to the `mods-available/` directory.

[source,shell]
----
cd raddb/mods-enabled && ln -s ../mods-available/ldap
----

== Calling the LDAP module

The LDAP module needs to be listed in different section depending on the
function(s) it's performing.

=== User authorization and group checks

For simple authentication types like `PAP` and `CHAP` the LDAP module
should be listed in the `recv Access-Request { ... }` (≥ v4.0.x)
or `authorize { ... }` (≤ v3.0.x) section of the virtual server
listening on the network (usually found in `sites-available/default`).

For EAP authentication the LDAP module should be listed in
`sites-available/inner-tunnel` instead.

The LDAP module's `authorize` method will discover the authenticating user's DN
and (optionally) cache that user's group memberships.

It will also (optionally) check whether a user is authorized to use a particular
service.

[source,config]
----
server default {
	...
	recv Access-Request {
		ldap
		...
	}
	...
}
----

Group checks may be performed _after_ the LDAP's authorize
method has run, using the pair comparison attribute `LDAP-Group`.

[source,unlang]
----
server default {
	...
	recv Access-Request {
		ldap
		if (&LDAP-Group != 'cn=authorized_users,ou=groups,dc=example,dc=com') {
			reject
		}
		...
	}
}
----

See xref:modules/ldap/authorization/index.adoc[LDAP authorization] for more detailed
information on configuring LDAP/Group authorization. Including how to perform
authorization _after_ authentication.

=== User authentication with LDAP binds

Before deciding which authentication to use, you should read
xref:concepts:modules/ldap/authentication.adoc[LDAP authentication concepts] as it will
explain which authentication methods are appropriate for different deployments
and authentication protocols.

LDAP binds for simple authentication types like `PAP` the LDAP module should be
listed in the `recv Access-Request { ... }` and `authenticate ldap { ... }` (≥
v4.0.x) or `authorize { ... }` and `authenticate { ... }` (≤ v3.0.x) sections of
the virtual server listening on the network (usually found in
`sites-available/default`).

For EAP authentication the LDAP module should be listed in
`sites-available/inner-tunnel` instead.  Be aware that LDAP binds will only work
for EAP methods which provide the user's password in the clear.

[source,unlang]
----
server default {
	...
	recv Access-Request {
		ldap
		if (ok || updated) {
			update control {
				&Auth-Type := ldap
			}
		}
	}

	authenticate ldap {
		ldap
	}
	...
}

See xref:modules/ldap/authentication.adoc[LDAP authentication] for more detailed
information on configuring LDAP authentication.

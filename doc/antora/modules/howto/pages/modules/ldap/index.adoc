= LDAP
== Introduction

FreeRADIUS can be configured to use an LDAP server for authentication,
authorization and accounting.

This series of tutorials assume that the reader is familiar LDAP. If you're not
familiar with LDAP specific terms or how LDAP directories in general operate,
you may wish to review https://ldap.com/basic-ldap-concepts/[ldap.com - basic
concepts], as these concepts will not be covered in FreeRADIUS documentation.

[NOTE]
====
In an Microsoft Active Directory environment you should use `rlm_winbind` for
authentication, and `rlm_ldap` for group membership checks as described in
xref:modules/ldap/authorization/index.adoc[authorization] section of this tuorial.
The WinBind protocol does not support the full range of group checks that is
possible with LDAP.

== Preparation

These preparation steps must be completed in order for the examples in the later
sections of this tutorial to operate correctly.

=== 1. Provisioning

In order to use LDAP, there must be an existing LDAP server populated with
users, groups, and possibly clients.  We highly recommend using
https://www.openldap.org/[OpenLDAP] for both its flexibility and performance.

If there is not an existing local LDAP server, then it is possible to provision
one using a xref:modules/ldap/docker.adoc[docker] image, or alternatively,
if you're using a Debian or RHEL based distribution, using the OpenLDAP LTB
https://ltb-project.org/documentation/openldap-rpm[RPMs] or
https://ltb-project.org/documentation/openldap-deb[DEBs].

For testing purposes it's recommended to install an LDAP instances on the same
machine (or inter-container network in the case of docker) as the RADIUS server
to avoid any potential networking issues.

This recommendation applies equally to high load production environments, or
where a high level of redundancy is required.

=== 2. Testing

Once an LDAP server is available, it should be tested via the command-line
xref:modules/ldap/ldapsearch/index.adoc[ldapsearch] tool.  This is to ensure that
the LDAP server has been configured correctly.  If testing via `ldapsearch`
fails, then that *MUST* those issues must be resolved before configuring
FreeRADIUS.

=== 3. Configuring the LDAP module

Once the xref:modules/ldap/ldapsearch/index.adoc[ldapsearch] validation tests pass, the
next step is to xref:modules/ldap/base_configuration/index.adoc[configure the LDAP module].

OpenLDAP configuration examples detailing how to install appropriate schemas and
populate the server with test data will be provided a the beginning of each
tutorial section.

== Sections in this tutorial

For features and configuration items not covered by this tutorial series
xref:raddb:modules/ldap.adoc[mods-available/ldap] page provides a complete
reference for all the configuration items available for the rlm_ldap module.

=== xref:modules/ldap/base_configuration/index.adoc[Base configuration]

Configures basic settings required for all functions of the LDAP module.

=== xref:modules/ldap/authorization/index.adoc[Authorization]

Covers Authorization by group, enabling/disabling accounts using attributes,
LDAP attribute to FreeRADIUS attribute mappings, and LDAP profiles.

=== xref:modules/ldap/authentication.adoc[Authentication]

Examples of configuring different methods of LDAP based authentication
(search, bind, edir).

=== xref:modules/ldap/accounting.adoc[Accounting]

Examples of updating objects in LDAP after authentication completes, or when
accounting data is received.

== Introduction

FreeRADIUS can call Lua scripts where there is need to utilize third party libraries
which are only available in Lua, or to execute particularly complex policy.

For optimal performance FreeRADIUS needs to be built against LuaJIT 2.1.
As a fallback, Lua 5.2 can be used.

== Module Configuration

Each `rlm_lua` module xref:reference:raddb/mods-available/lua.adoc[instance]
should set a `filename` option which is the Lua file from which functions
will be loaded.

An `instantiate` and `detach` function can be defined to run code during server
start up and shutdown.

When `rlm_lua` is called in a processing section, by default the function
called is based on the section name. e.g. if the call is made in `recv Access-Request`
then, `recv_access_request` will be called if it exists, otherwise `recv` will
be called.

In order to override the function being called, configuration options such as
`func_recv_access_request` or `func_recv` can be used. e.g.

```
func_recv_access_request = authorize
```

could be used to use function names which mirror FreeRADIUS v3 processing sections.

If `rlm_lua` is called with a suffix, e.g.

```
lua.my_function
```

then, by default `my_function` will be called.  As with other calls the function can
be specified with `func_my_function`.

== Lua function behaviour

When a Lua function is called, a global table `fr` is available which contains
the following keys:

  * `request` - a table giving access to the pairs in the `request` list
  * `control` - a table giving access to the `control` list
  * `reply` - a table giving access to the `reply` list
  * `session-state` - a table giving access to the `session-state` list.
  * `log` - a table of functions which can be used to write FreeRADIUS log messages.
  * `rcode` - a table of FreeRADIUS rcodes to use as function return values.

=== Attribute access and setting

Attributes can be accessed as follows:

  * `fr.request["User-Name"]` will return a table representing all the instances
    of `User-Name` in the `request` list.
  * `fr.request["User-Name"][1]` will return the value of the first instance of
    `User-Name` in the `request` list.

**Note**: in `unlang` attribute instances start at zero, whereas Lua arrays typically
start at 1 - so `User-Name[0]` in unlang becomes `fr.request["User-Name"][1]` in Lua.

Nested attributes are accessed using syntax of the form:

  * `fr.request["Vendor-Specific"]["Cisco"]["AVPair"][1]` - the value of
    `Vendor-Specific.Cisco.AVPair`.
  * `fr.request["Vendor-Specific"]["3GPP2"]["Remote-IP"][2]["Address"][1]` - the value
    of `Vendor-Specific.3GPP2.Remote-IP[1].Address`.

Attribute lists and structural attributes have a `pairs` field which can be used to
return an itterative list of the names and values of the child pairs.

```
for k, v in fr.request.pairs() do
  print(k, v)
end
```

When the attribute returned by `pairs()` is structural, the value returned will be
an array of child attribute names.

Leaf attributes have a `pairs` field which can be used to return the values of all
the instances of the attribute, e.g.

```
for v in fr.request["Vendor-Specific"]["Cisco"]["AVPair"].pairs() do
  print(v)
end
```

Setting attributes can be done by setting the value of the specific instance e.g.

```
fr.reply["Vendor-Specific"]["Cisco"]["AVPair"][1] = "foo=baa"
```

If the pair does not exist then it will be created.  Note that you cannot create
gaps in the instances of an attriute, e.g. if there is a single instance of
attribute `foo` in the reply list, you can add an additional one by setting
`fr.reply["foo"][2]` but setting `fr.reply["foo"][3]` is not valid.

=== Log messages

FreeRADIUS log messages can be created using functions in the `fr.log` table e.g.

```
fr.log.debug("Log message from Lua")
```

The functions provided are:

  * `debug`
  * `info`
  * `warn`
  * `error`

which will produce log messages sent to the configured FreeRADIUS destination at the
corresponding log level.

=== Function return values

Functions should return a FreeRADIUS rcode using values from the `fr.rcode` table e.g.

```
return fr.rcode.ok
```

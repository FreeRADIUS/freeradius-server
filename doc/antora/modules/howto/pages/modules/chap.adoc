= Configuring the CHAP module

The xref:raddb:mods-available/chap.adoc[mods-available/chap]
configuration file describes the configuration parameters accepted by
the CHAP module, and what they do.  This document explains how to
perform testing with the CHAP module.

include::howto:partial$pre_test.adoc[]

== Editing mods-available/chap

The xref:raddb:mods-available/chap.adoc[mods-available/chap] module
contains no configuration items, and does not need to be edited.

== Enabling mods-available/chap

The `chap` module is enabled by creating a soft link from the
`mods-enabled/` directory to the `mods-available/` directory.

[source,shell]
----
cd raddb/mods-enabled && ln -s ../mods-available/chap
----

The default installation will automatically enable the `chap` module.
In most circumstances, no additional work is required.

== Testing the Server

include::howto:partial$post_test.adoc[]

== Testing CHAP Authentication

Once the server is started in debugging mode, CHAP authentication can
be performed via the following command:

[source,shell]
----
cat <<'EOF' | radclient -x localhost auth testing123
User-Name = "bob"
CHAP-Password = "hello"
EOF
----

The `radclient` program is smart enough to see that the
`CHAP-Password` attribute is a cleartext password.  It then performs
CHAP calculations in order to put the correct `CHAP-Password` value
into the packet.

NOTE: The server must be configured with a known user and a "known
good" password before any CHAP tests are performed.  In this case, we
assume that the server knows about a user `bob` with password `hello`.

The output of `radclient` should look like the following.  Some of the
numbers may be different, but the general format should be the same.

[source,log]
----
Sent Access-Request Id 47 from 0.0.0.0:52132 to 127.0.0.1:1812 length 44
	User-Name = "bob"
	CHAP-Password = 0x70170db9ab2baad7ca45b3ef9cd844eccd
	Cleartext-Password = "bob"
Received Access-Accept Id 47 from 127.0.0.1:1812 to 127.0.0.1:52132 length 25
	User-Name = "bob"
----

This output indicates that the authentication request was accepted.

Next, read the server output.  The goal here is to look for messages
containing `ERROR` or `WARNING`, or the `chap` module name.

[source,log]
----

...
----

For the purposes of this test, the other messages in the debug output
can be ignored.

In the above output, the `chap` module is first run in the `recv
Access-Request { ... }` section.  The module looks for `CHAP-Password`
in the request packet, and if found, sets `Auth-Type := CHAP`.  That
setting tells the server core to call the `chap` module again for
authentication.

Once the `recv Access-Request { ... }` section has finished
processing, the server calls the `authenticate chap { ... }` section.
In the default configuration, that section contains just a reference
to the `chap` module.  The `chap` module finds a `Cleartext-Password`
which has previously been added to the request, and performs the CHAP
calculations.  If the calculated CHAP values match the CHAP values in
the request packet, then the user is authenticated.  Otherwise,
authentication fails and the user is rejected.

This two-phase processing of CHAP ensures that the `chap` module is
independent of any database.  That is, the "known good" password can
be obtained from any other module, such as `ldap`, `sql`, `files`,
etc.  The `chap` module only needs to know that it handles CHAP, and
that it has been given a `Cleartext-Password` in order to authenticate
the user.  The source of that `Cleartext-Password` is unimportant.

== Disabling CHAP

The local system requirements may be that CHAP authentication is
forbidden.  In that case, the `chap` module should be removed from the
`recv Access-Request { ... }` section, and the `authenticate chap {
... }` section should be deleted.  The server will then be unable to
process CHAP authentication requests.  All `Access-Request` packets
that contain a `CHAP-Password` attribute will then result in an
`Access-Reject`.

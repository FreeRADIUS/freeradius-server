= Generating IPs for the pools.

The `scripts/sql/generate_pool_addresses.pl` file is a helper script
for populating IP pools with address entries.

The script generates output which is useful for populating an IP pool
for use with FreeRADIUS (and possibly other purposes). The pool may be
implemented as an SQL IP Pool (the `sqlippool` module) or any other
backing store that has one entry per IP address.

This script output a list of address to add, retain and remove in order to
align a pool to a specification. It is likely that you will want to
process the output to generate the actual commands (e.g. SQL statements)
that make changes to the datastore. For example:

[source,shell]
----
generate_pool_addresses.pl ... | align_sql_pools.pl postgresql
----

Once the IP addresses have been generated, 

== Use with a single address range

For basic use, arguments can be provided to this script that denote the ends
of a single IP (v4 or v6) address range together with the pool_name.

Optionally the number of IPs to sparsely populate the range with can be
provided. If the range is wider than a /16 then the population of the range
is capped at 65536 IPs, unless otherwise specified.

In the case that a sparse range is defined, a file containing pre-existing
IP entries can be provided. The range will be populated with entries from
this file that fall within the range, prior to the remainder of the range
being populated with random address in the range.

[source,shell]
----
generate_pool_addresses.pl <pool_name> <range_start> <range_end> \
          [ <capacity> [ <existing_ips_file> ] ]
----

NOTE: Sparse ranges are populated using a deterministic, pseudo-random
function. This allows pools to be trivially extended without having to
supply the existing contents using a file. If you require
less-predictable randomness or a different random sequence then remove
or modify the line calling srand(), below.


### Use with multiple pools and address ranges

For more complex us, the script allows a set of pool definitions to be
provided in a YAML file which describes a set of one or more pools, each
containing a set of one or more ranges. The first argument in this case is
always "yaml":

[source,shell]
----
generate_pool_addresses.pl yaml <pool_defs_yaml_file> [ <existing_ips_file> ]
----

The format for the YAML file is demonstrated by the following example:

----
pool_with_a_single_contiguous_range:
  - start:    192.0.2.3
    end:      192.0.2.250

pool_with_a_single_sparse_range:
  - start:    10.10.10.0
    end:      10.10.20.255
    capacity: 200

pool_with_multiple_ranges:
  - start:    10.10.10.1
    end:      10.10.10.253
  - start:    10.10.100.0
    end:      10.10.199.255
    capacity: 1000

v6_pool_with_contiguous_range:
  - start:    '2001:db8:1:2:3:4:5:10'
    end:      '2001:db8:1:2:3:4:5:7f'

v6_pool_with_sparse_range:
  - start:    '2001:db8:1:2::'
    end:      '2001:db8:1:2:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff'
    capacity: 200
----

As with the basic use case, a file containing pre-existing IP entries can be
provided with which any sparse ranges will be populated ahead of any random
addresses.

=== Output

The script returns line-based output beginning with `+`, `=` or `-`, and
includes the pool_name and an IP address.


`+ pool_name 192.0.2.10`::

  A new address to be added to the corresponding range in the pool.

`pool_name 192.0.2.20`::

  A pre-existing address that is to be retained in the pool. (Only if a
  pre-existing pool entries file is given.)

`pool_name 192.0.2.30`::

  A pre-existing address that is to be removed from the corresponding
  range in the pool. (Only if a pre-existing pool entries file is given.)

`# main_pool: 192.0.10.3 - 192.0.12.250 (500)`::

  Lines beginning with "#" are comments

.Example of creating a fully populated IP range.
=============================================

[source,shell]
----
generate_pool_addresses.pl main_pool 192.0.2.3 192.0.2.249
----

Will create a pool from a full populated IPv4 range, i.e. all IPs in the
range available for allocation).
=============================================


.Example of creating a sparsely populated pool.
=============================================

[source,shell]
----
generate_pool_addresses.pl main_pool 10.66.0.0 10.66.255.255 10000
----

Will create a pool from a sparsely populated IPv4 range for a `/16`
network (maximum of 65.536 addresses), populating the range with 10,000
addreses. The effective size of the pool can be increased in future by
increasing the capacity of the range with:

=============================================

[source,shell]
----
generate_pool_addresses.pl main_pool 10.66.0.0 10.66.255.255 20000
----

This command will generate the same initial set of 10,000 addresses as
the previous example but will create 20,000 addresses overall, unless
the random seed has been changed since the initial run.

[source,shell]
----
generate_pool_addresses.pl main_pool 2001:db8:1:2:: \
  2001:db8:1:2:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff
----

Will create a pool from the IPv6 range `2001:db8:1:2::/64`, initially
populating the range with 65536 (by default) addresses.
=============================================


.Example of extending a previously populated IPv6 pool.

[source,shell]
----
generate_pool_addresses.pl main_pool 2001:db8:1:2:: \
  2001:db8:1:2:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff \
  10000 existing_ips.txt
----

Will create a pool using the same range as the previous example, but
this time the range will be populated with 10,000 addresses.  The range
will be populated using lines extracted from the `existing_ips.txt` file
that represent IPs which fall within range.
=============================================


.Example of creating pools from a YAML file.
=============================================

[source,shell]
----
generate_pool_addresses.pl yaml pool_defs.yml existing_ips.txt
----

Will create one of more pools using the definitions found in the
`pool_defs.yml` YAML file. The pools will contain one or more ranges with
each of the ranges first being populated with entries from the
`existing_ips.txt` file that fall within the range, before being filled
with random addresses to the defined capacity.

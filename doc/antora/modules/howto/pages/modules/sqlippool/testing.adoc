= Basic Setup Tests

Start by creating some text files holding the test request data based on the
actual form of the contents of packets originating from the NAS.

.Example RADIUS requests text files for testing SQL IP Pools
=============================================

.access-request.rad
[source,config]

=============================================

Now run through a series of tests examining the effect on the `fr_ippool`
tables at each stage to ensure that it matches the expected behaviour as
described in the <<operation,Operation section>>.


== Test initial authentication

Send the Access Request to FreeRADIUS.

[source,terminal]
----
cat access-request.rad | radclient -x 127.0.0.1 auth testing123
Sent Access-Request Id 1 from 0.0.0.0:2000 to 127.0.0.1:1812 length 81
	Password.Cleartext = "testing123"
	User-Name = "bob"
	User-Password = "testing123"
	Calling-Station-Id = "00:53:00:11:22:33"
	NAS-Port = 12345
	NAS-IP-Address = 192.0.2.5
Received Access-Accept Id 1 from 127.0.0.1:1812 to 0.0.0.0:2000 length 31
	User-Name = "bob"
	Framed-IP-Address = 192.0.2.10
----

Note that an IP address has been issued in the `Framed-IP-Address` of the
reply.

[TIP]
====
If you do no receive an IP address then start FreeRADIUS in debugging mode
to determine where the process if failing as described in the
https://wiki.freeradius.org/guide/radiusd-X[guide to debugging FreeRADIUS]. Do
not proceed until you have resolved the IP allocation issue.
====

Check the status of the `fr_ippool` table.

[source,terminal]
----
echo "SELECT * FROM fr_ippool WHERE gateway <> ''" | mysql radius
+----+-----------+------------+-------+-----------+---------------------+---------+
| id | pool_name | address    | owner | gateway   | expiry_time         | status  |
+----+-----------+------------+-------+-----------+---------------------+---------+
| 1  | internet  | 192.0.2.10 | bob   | 192.0.2.5 | 2020-01-01 10:10:10 | dynamic |
+----+-----------+------------+-------+-----------+---------------------+---------+
1 rows in set (0.0030 sec)
----

For the entry matching the given IP address ensure that the IP allocation has
been recorded correctly. Check that:

. The `owner` matches the expected value of the unique identifier that you
chose. Double check that values of this form will be unique across all of your
devices.

. The `expiry_time` is `lease_duration` seconds ahead of the time of the
request (or some fixed value that you chose for the initial lease if you
updated the default policy.)

. The `gateway` has been provided. If not then you may need to
reconfigure your NAS to provide this or instantiate this attribute from
`Net.Src.IP` using an unlang policy in FreeRADIUS. Otherwise when
the NAS reboots you will not be able to match the affected IP addresses to the
device.

Update your sample text files containing the accounting requests to include the
allocated IP Address *before proceeding* with accounting packet testing.


== Test Accounting Start

[source,terminal]
----
cat accounting-start.rad | radclient -x 127.0.0.1 acct testing123
----

Check the status of the `fr_ippool` table.

For the entry matching the given IP address ensure that *initial lease
extension* is occurring by verifying that the `expiry_time` is in the future by
`lease_duration` seconds from the time of the request.


== Test Accounting Interim-Update

[source,terminal]
----
cat accounting-alive.rad | radclient -x 127.0.0.1 acct testing123
----

Check the status of the `fr_ippool` table.

For the entry matching the given IP address ensure that *IP address renewal* is
occurring by verifying that the `expiry_time` is in the future by
`lease_duration` seconds from the time of the request.


== Test Accounting Stop

[source,terminal]
----
cat accounting-stop.rad | radclient -x 127.0.0.1 acct testing123
----

Check the status of the `fr_ippool` table.

For the entry matching the given IP address ensure that *IP address release* is
occurring by verifying that the `expiry_time` is set prior to the current time
or is null.


== Additional tests

* Repeat this authentication test with the same user to ensure that the same IP
address is allocated for a re-authentication of an ongoing session.

* Repeat the authentication test with multiple users to ensure that each user is
assigned a unique IP address.

* Test that `Accounting On/Off` packets clear all sessions owned by the NAS.

* If you have already enabled a sticky IP policy then ensure that user
and device data is not removed when an `Accounting Stop` (and `Accounting
On/Off`) request is received. Ensure that users receive their previous IP
address when they authenticate using a device whose recent session is
disconnected.

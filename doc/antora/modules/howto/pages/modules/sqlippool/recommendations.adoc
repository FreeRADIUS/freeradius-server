== Additional configuration

Once the initial configuration is working there are some additional recommended
configuration steps to consider.

The basic configuration arrived at in the previous section will be functional
but it is likely to exhibit poor performance under concurrent load. It also
implements a simple, dynamic IP allocation policy that you may want to change.


=== Enable the IP allocation stored procedure

The stored procedure is provided as an efficient means to both find and
allocate an IP address with a single SQL call so that no locks are held across
rounds trips between FreeRADIUS and the database. Depending on the database
software and configuration the stored procedure may increase the IP allocation
performance by as much as 100x and ensure that the system doesn't fail due to
excessive locking under high load.

Load the IP allocation stored procedure in the `procedure.sql` file
corresponding to the database dialect.

Methods vary between databases, but a typical example would be:

[source,shell]
----
mysql radius < /etc/raddb/mods-config/sql/ippool/mysql/procedure.sql
----

[NOTE]
====
The above command assumes that passwordless login has been configured via
the userâ€™s `~/.my.cnf` file, or otherwise.
====

Read the comments in the `procedure.sql` file which explain how to use
the stored procedure, then amend the `alloc_find`, and
`allocate_update` queries (as well as the corresponding start/end
transaction query-parts) in the dialect's `queries.conf` file,
*exactly as described*.


.Example queries.conf configuration to use the stored procedure with MySQL
=============================================

[raddb]/mods-config/sql/ipool/<dialect>/queries.conf
[source,config]
----
...
allocate_begin = ""

alloc_find = "\
      CALL fr_ippool_allocate_previous_or_new_address( \
              '%{control.${pool_name}}', \
              '${gateway}', \
              '${owner}', \
              ${lease_duration}, \
	      '%{${requested_address} || 0.0.0.0}' \
      )"

allocate_update = ""

allocate_commit = ""

...
----

=============================================

Now that the IP allocation stored procedure has been enabled you should re-test
your configuration.


=== Customize the IP allocation policy

The IP allocation policy is mainly configured by modifying the `alloc_find`
query, however it is likely that the other queries will also need to be
modified to get the results you want.

By default each user is likely to get a different IP address each time they
authenticate unless they re-authenticate before their existing session has
terminated (as is the case with many EAP-based implementations during "fast
re-authentication").

Often it is required that upon reconnection a device obtains its previous IP
address, sometimes referred to as a "sticky IPs" policy.

If you are using the base queries (rather than the recommended stored
procedure) then the `queries.conf` file for your database dialect contains
several example `alloc_find` queries for choosing either a dynamic or sticky
IP policy.

If you are using the recommended stored procedure then the `procedure.sql` file
which contains the definition of the stored procedure for your database dialect
has comments that explain how to amend the procedure to choose either a dynamic
or sticky IP policy.

With a sticky IP policy it is necessary to amend the default actions
of the `release_clear` and `bulk_release_clear` queries.  By default,
each of these queries clobbers the `owner` column when sessions expire
therefore erasing the affinity information.

[TIP]
====
A performance benefit of sticky IP addresses derived from the fact that
reallocation of an existing IP address is generally much quicker than
allocating a new IP address since it generally involves an indexed lookup of a
single IP address based on the device's request attributes rather than a walk
of the table's indexes.

                LIMIT 1
                FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED;
        END IF;
...
----

=============================================

Now that you have amended your IP allocation policy you should re-test your
configuration carefully to validate each of the amended queries and exercise
all of the features of your policy.

If your testing passes then FreeRADIUS should now be ready to allocate IP
addresses.


== Design Considerations

[#database-performance]
=== Choose a database server

The performance of the `sqlippool` module is much more sensitive to the choice
of backend database than is typical for other FreeRADIUS database workloads.

The `sqlippool` module allocates IP addresses by using a relational database to
implement the "accept" part of a "worker queue" pattern, where multiple workers
attempt to select a single, unique work item from an unordered queue. In our
case the queue is the IP pool and each worker is an authentication request
attempting to reserve a unique IP address.

The overall performance largely depends on how directly and optimally the
database server software supports this pattern.

In particular, the SQL standard introduces two pragmas that facilitate an
optimised implementation of a worker queue:

`SELECT FOR UPDATE ...`::
Selects rows while exclusively locking them to prevent simultaneous locking
reads and writes of those same rows. When connections are simultaneously
selecting an IP address from a pool this pragma is what provides the guarantee
of uniqueness of the IP selected for each authentication request.

`... SKIP LOCKED`::
This is a modifier for `SELECT FOR UPDATE` that optimises the select by
allowing each reader to disregard any locked rows in order to avoid blocking.
This pragma avoids the "thundering herd" problem that can cripple performance
during highly concurrent IP allocation: Several authentication requests wait a
lock to be release on a single IP address that is in the process of being
allocated to a device. When the lock is release all but one of these previously
blocked connections block waiting for the next free IP address to be allocated.
And so on until they have all been serviced or their query times out... In the
absence of this pragma concurrent authentication requests are unnecessarily
serialised while their IP addresses are allocated resulting in poor
performance.

Here are some comments regarding the main database engines in relation to this
issue:

==== PostgreSQL

Since version 9.5 provides a direct implementation of the `SELECT ... FOR
UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` statement which means that it is a very efficient backend
for `sqlippool`.

==== MySQL::
Ensure that you use a storage engine what supports transactions such as InnoDB.
Do not use MyISAM. Since version 8 the InnoDB storage engine provides a direct
implementation of the `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` statement which means
that it is a very efficient backend for `sqlippool`. Previous versions do not
implement the `SKIP LOCKED` pragma and will therefore have poor performance
under concurrent load, _but see the tip concerning the alternative stored
procedure below_.

==== MariaDB

Ensure that you use a storage engine what supports transactions such as InnoDB.
Do not use MyISAM or Aria. All versions of MariaDB lack `SKIP LOCKED` and
therefore will have poor performance under concurrent load, _but see the tip
concerning the alternative stored procedure below_. Given the choice between
MariaDB and a recent version of MySQL you should use MySQL for SQL IP Pools.

==== MS SQL Server

Does not provide a `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE` implementation nor a direct means to
provide a row-level, exclusive lock that ensures uniqueness of the selected
row. However FreeRADIUS is able to use an artificial `UPDATE` of a selected row
along with non-standard "hints" to obtain the required `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE
SKIP LOCKED` semantics, but we pay a performance penalty by doing so. The
overall performance is moderate but it does not collapse under concurreent
load.

==== Oracle

Provides a direct implementation of the `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED`
statement. It should be very efficient but limitations of the query syntax
result in the need to use multiple subqueries for which pay a performance
penalty. The overall performance is moderate but it does not collapse under
concurreent load.

==== SQLite

Does not provide a `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE` implementation due to its simplified
locking characteristics. The only locking that is available for this purpose is
an exclusive lock taken over the entire database. This makes it unsuitable for
anything other than managing a small number of devices.  In addition the locking
model used by SQLite means that when a lock exists on the database, not even
`SELECT` queries can be initiated.  This means that use of SQLite as the
backend database for an sqlippool module should only be done with FreeRADIUS
running with a single worker thread.

[TIP]
.Alternative stored procedure for MariaDB and MySQL < 8.0
===================================================================================

The file `procedure_no_skip_locked.sql` contains an alternative stored
procedure that is intended exclusively for MySQL variants that do not support
the `SKIP LOCKED` pragma, i.e. all MariaDB versions and versions of MySQL prior
to 8.0.

It should be a lot faster than using the default stored procedure under highly
concurrent workloads and should not result in thread starvation. It can best be
described as a useful hack that should not be used except when the
better-performing `SKIP LOCKED` method is unavailable.

This procedure works by using "user locks" to provide skippable, row-level
locking that facilitates non-blocking selection of unique IP addresses from the
pool. We pay a performance penalty for managing the locks, however it is
nowhere near as bad as serialising all concurrent pool access.

Since user locks are local to the database server instance this procedure is
not suitable for a multi-master cluster.

===================================================================================

[#database-clusters]
=== Database clusters (e.g. MaxScale, Galera)

It is usually the case that row-level locks issued by `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE`
do not propagate around database clusters which means that unique IP address
selection cannot always be guaranteed.

Ingress nodes (relays, proxies, etc.) typically balance reads across all
cluster nodes (master and slave) while sending writes to one or more masters.
For many workloads this guarantees an appropriate level of data coherency,
however for an IP pool allocation implementation this is insufficient since we
must guarantee that no two nodes may concurrently `SELECT` the same IP address
from the pool of free addresses.

With clusters the behaviour is normally that when multiple connections
initially select the same IP address, one of them will succeed and when the
remaining transactions attempt to finalise the lease of the already-allocated
IP address only then will the conflict be detected.

When this occurs the sane and correct behaviour of most clusters is for
deadlocks to be generated for all but the first transaction and for them to be
rolled back. However this will result in IP allocation failures, which is
likely to be reported as an `Access-Reject`.

[CAUTION]
====
If however the cluster does not abort the transactions but goes on to
erroneously commit them, duplicate IP addresses will be allocated! It is
therefore critical to understand how your database cluster manages this case.
====

Incorrectly configured clusters are likely to have generally good performance
under high volumes of serialised load but may exhibit a performance cliff-edge
once a moderate level of concurrency is reached. The main symptom of this would
be the sudden onset of deadlock. Test your cluster under conditions that
represent the maximum load on the system, such as all devices simultaneously
re-authenticating after some form of failure.

[TIP]
====
In some cases it may be possible to alleviate these kinds of issue by
using a `redundant` policy for the `sql` module instances rather than a
`load-balance` policy, or by adding routing hints to the SQL queries to direct
all SQL IP Pool related queries to a single cluster node.
====


[#device-identifier]
=== Choose a device identifier

Prior to issuing IP addresses to devices it is necessary to determine how to
uniquely identify devices to which IP addresses will be assigned on the basis
of the available RADIUS attributes.

In many fixed-line configurations a unique identifier for a device may be the
`NAS-Port` or `NAS-Port-Id`. In other scenarios identifiers based on the NAS
port may be shared by several devices and are unsuitable for uniquely
identifying devices. In some cases a circuit-specific identifier such as
`Vendor-Specific.ADSL-Forum.Agent-Circuit-ID` may be present.

[CAUTION]
====
However, a circuit-specific identifier is unsuitable if there are
multiple hosts on the circuit with which you issue individual addresses (for
example when using PPPoE passthrough to provide unique sessions to firewalls
behind a separate CPE modem.) In this case the "device" must be thought of not
as the circuit but the individual hosts behind it.
====

The `Calling-Station-Id` attribute may contain host specific information (such
as a hardware address). You should consider the provenance of the data and
whether you trust it, e.g. does it report a MAC address that is under an
untrusted user's control.  Sometimes a combination of attributes including one
that you trust (such as "%{Vendor-Specific.ADSL-Forum.Agent-Circuit-ID}:%{Calling-Station-Id}") may
be appropriate.

The `owner` is used to issue indexed lookups into the `fr_ippool` table so for
performance reasons it should have differentiation in the leading characters.
You need to understand your network configuration and the available RADIUS
attributes to determine what is an acceptable `owner`. You may need to
reconfigure your NAS to provide a suitable unique device identifier.

[TIP]
====
Most NASs allow the content of the `Calling-Station-Id` to the customised
so that in includes device specific information and network-related information
(such as SSID in the case of wireless networks).
====

[NOTE]
====
When accounting is enabled it is essential that any `owner` attribute
is included in *both authentication and accounting requests*. Otherwise lease
renewal will fail and IP addresses will be prematurely returned to the pool
before sessions have disconnected, resulting in duplicate IP allocations.
====

[#lease-duration]
=== Choose a lease duration

`sqlippools` manages the status of the IP addresses (either leased or free)
using the `expiry_time` of each entry in the `fr_ippool` table. If it is in the
future then the IP address is considered to be actively leased (in use by a
device), otherwise it is free to be re-allocated to a device.

The `lease_duration` configuration item is used to set the `expiry_time` for an
IP address lease both when it is allocated at the start of a session and renewed
during an ongoing session.  The `expiry_time` is set to `lease_duration`
seconds after the current time. `expiry_time` and `lease_duration` are used as
a means to manage the IP address pools. They are not communicated to the NAS or
device.

In access networks where the IP address pool is plentiful and sessions have a
defined maximum length (for example when `Session-Timeout` RADIUS attribute is
being honoured), setting a `lease_duration` that is a little longer than the
maximum permitted session length is acceptable.

Often either the session duration is not restricted or the capacity of the pool
is small (relative to the number of devices) so that it needs careful
management to continuously free IP addresses that are no longer in active use.

Normally *accounting must be enabled* on the NAS and *an accounting interim
interval set* for two reasons:


. `Accounting Interim-Update` requests indicate that an IP address is still in
use by an ongoing session. This causes the lease to be periodically extended
before it expires and prevents an IP address from being prematurely freed as
this would result in active sessions having duplicate IP addresses.

. `Accounting Stop` (and `Accounting On/Off`) requests indicate that an IP
address is no longer in use so that it can be immediately released. This
ensures that a IP address is not leases longer than necessary and avoids wasted
pool space when a group of devices reconnect after their sessions are
interrupted.

[CAUTION]
====
It is essential that Accounting Interim-Update requests are
received reliably. Many NASs will repeat accounting requests that are not
acknowledged by a RADIUS server or forward them elsewhere. You should
determine whether accounting requests are delivered reliably in your network.
====

If accounting requests are received reliably then `lease_duration` could be set a little longer than *twice the accounting interim interval* to handle the
occasional lost interim-update. Otherwise the lease duration might need to be
set several times longer.

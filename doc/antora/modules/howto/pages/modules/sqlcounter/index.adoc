= SQL counter module

== Introduction

The `sqlcounter` module provides a mechanism which can be used to enforce periodic
resource limits.

Each instance of the module is configured with a period (e.g. daily) which is used
to populate values in two attributes in the `control` list when the module is
called.

An attribute is defined to contain a "limit" for whatever resource is being counted,
(e.g. session time or data volume) for the specified period.

If that attribute exists, the module will run an SQL query to calculate the used
resource quantity.

The retrieved value is then compared with the limit and if the limit has been
exceeded, the module will return `reject`

== Configuration

A sample module configuration is provided in `raddb/mods-available/sqlcounter`.

This includes configurations which cover daily and monthly periods, plus a
couple of examples where there are no reset dates on the periods being considered.

The SQL queries associated with these sample module configurations are found
in `raddb/mods-config/sql/counter/<dialect>/*.conf` with each instances query
in a different file.

As provided, the counters are all based on session time, using the `acctsessiontime`,
field from `radacct`.

In order to enforce limits based on data volume, the queries should be updated to
use the `acctinputoctets` and / or `acctoutputoctets` fields depending on the
requirement.

See the sample module configuration for details of the configuration options.

== Usage

As a prerequisite to using the `sqlcounter` module with the sample configurations
an instance of the `sql` module must be configured and called when processing
accounting packets.

This instance of the `sql` module should be set as the `sql_module_instance`
in the `sqlcounter` module configuration.

Depending on how user limits are to be set, appropriate entries should be
added to the relevant source data store being used to set `control` attributes
during authorization.  e.g. if the `sql` module is being used to hold user
data, add entries to `radcheck` or `radgroupcheck` as appropriate.

The attribute to set is the one referred to in the `check_name` module,
configuration, e.g. on the sample `dailycounter` module instance the attribute
is `control.Max-Daily-Session`.

In the authorization policy, call the required `sqlcounter` module instance,
having made sure that the appropriate `check_name` attribute is set.

If the configured query returns a value which exceeds the value in the limit
attribute, the module will return `reject` and populate the attribute set
in `reply_message_name`.

If the retrieved value is below the limit, then the attribute set in
`reply_name` will be populated in the `reply` list with the difference
between the limit and the retrieved value and the module will return `updated`.

If that attribute already exists with a lower value, that value will be
left and the module will return `ok`.

If no `reply_name` is configured, then the module returns `ok`.

For the use case where the reply attribute is being used to set a point when
a user re-authenticates, specifically using time (in seconds), the option
`auto_extend` can be used to avoid unnecessary re-authentications.

Setting this option to `yes` causes a check to be done to see if the difference
between the configured limit and the retrieved value is sufficient to cover the
time to the next period.  If it is, then the value returned in the reply
attribute will be the number of seconds until the next period plus the value of
the limit.

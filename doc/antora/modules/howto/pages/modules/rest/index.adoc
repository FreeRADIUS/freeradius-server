== Introduction

FreeRADIUS can be used to communicate with REST APIs.

== REST base configuration

This section describes the basic configuration needed to configure the REST
module to communicate with a REST service.

== xref:modules/rest/fixed_data.adoc[Calling REST endpoints with fixed data formats]

The REST module was developed to allow business logic to be separated out into a
separate discreet service.  This reduces the role of FreeRADIUS to a translation
daemon, receiving packets from the network and presenting them in JSON or POST
format for consumption by the API, then parsing a JSON or POST response, and
translating that back into a network packet.

If you will be developing a new REST API to implement business logic for a AAA
service, you should follow the guide in this section, and accept and return
data in that format the REST module expected.

== xref:modules/rest/custom_data.adoc[Calling REST endpoints with a custom data format]

The REST module can also communicate with arbitrary REST endpoints,
and versions â‰¥ v4.0.x include a JSON module xref:raddb/mods-available/json[JSON]
which allows mapping elements of a JSON response to FreeRADIUS.

If you're attempting to integrate an existing REST API, this section will provide
hints on how to accomplish this.

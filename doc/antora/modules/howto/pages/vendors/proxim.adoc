== Description

Proxim AP-2000 NASes up to and including firmware version 2.4.5 ignore
the `Session-Timeout` attribute, despite the fact that Proximâ€™s firmware
release notes specifically state that it is supported. On top of this,
firmware version 2.4.5 (the latest as of this writing) has a bug in
which the reauthentication interval on the AP cannot be set to any value
less than 2 hours.

As such, fine-grained control of client session times is not currently
possible with this NAS. Note that this NAS is OEMed to several vendors,
including Avaya, and may be listed under different names with different
vendors.

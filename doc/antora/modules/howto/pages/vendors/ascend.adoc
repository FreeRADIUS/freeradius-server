= Ascend

== Description

FreeRADIUS uses Vendor-Specific attributes to send the Ascend attributes. By default, Ascend NASes transmit the Ascend-specific attributes as Non-VSA attributes. However, these Non-VSA attributes conflict with the current RADIUS attributes defined by the IETF. This design error by Ascend persists and continues to cause many issues.

FreeRADIUS developed workarounds to address this problem. If you see a lot of messages about invalid `Message-Authenticator` attribute, you most likely are affected by this problem.

You have two options:

=== Option 1: Enable VSA's on the Ascend/Lucent MAX

This option is the preferred method as it resolves many other problems.

==== Max6000/4000 Series TAOS with Menued Interfaces

Configure the Auth client interface:

. Go to `Ethernet->Mod Config->Auth`.
. At the bottom of the menu, change Auth-Compat from `OLD` to `VSA`.
. Save your changes, no reboot is needed.

Next, configure the Acct client interface:

. Go to `Ethernet->Mod Config->Acct`.
. At the bottom of the menu, change Acct-Compat from `OLD` to `VSA`.
. Save your changes, no reboot is needed.

==== Max TNT/Apex 8000 Series TAOS with CLI:
=====================================================
```
nas> read external-auth
nas> set rad-auth-client auth-radius-compat = vendor-specific
nas> set rad-acct-client acct-radius-compat = vendor-specific
nas> write
```
=====================================================

=== Option 2: Enable OLD attributes in FreeRADIUS

Cisco provides an Ascend compatibility mode that accepts
only the OLD style Ascend attributes, which may be problematic.

You can make FreeRADIUS send the OLD style attributes by prefixing the
Ascend attributes with `X-` in the `raddb/mods-config/files/authorize` file,
`sql` table, `ldap` directory, `attr_filter` module, etcâ€¦

The original VSA Ascend attribute:

```
 Ascend-Data-Filter
```

becomes the OLD Ascend attribute using the `X-` prefix:

```
 X-Ascend-Data-Filter
```

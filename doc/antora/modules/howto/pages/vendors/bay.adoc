= BAY

== Description

All versions of the BAY software prior to _18.0.2_ are broken in regards
to the `Message-Authenticator`. The software sends a strictly MD5 encoded secret
instead of the encoding required by the RFC. This has been fixed in
*18.0.2* only.

If you see messages in the radius log like:

```
Received packet from xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx with invalid Message-Authenticator!
```

Then you MUST upgrade the software on your Bay Annex. There is NO other solution to the problem.

= Alvarion

Alvarion gateways mplement a non-standard version of WiMAX.  If you with to use Alvarion, you *must* use the "master" branch from http://git.freeradius.org.  Then, before you install it, do:

  $ cd share
  $ vi dictionary

Find the two matching lines with:

  $INCLUDE dictionary.alvarion
  ...
  $INCLUDE dictionary.wimax

and change them to:

  $INCLUDE dictionary.alvarion.wimax.v2_2
  ...
  $INCLUDE dictionary.wimax.alvarion

Save the file, and then do:

  $ make install

Note that you *cannot* build an RPM or other package if you are using Alvarion.  You *must* install from source.

The reason for the above changes is that they have non-standard versions of the dictionaries.  These dictionaries are incompatible with all other WiMAX equipment, so they are not enabled by default.

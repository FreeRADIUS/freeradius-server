# Alcatel-Lucent and Radius

Alcatel-Lucent Enterprise(http://enterprise.alcatel-lucent.com/) runs various product lines. In the beginning this page will focus on the configuration of/for OmniSwitch products.

## OmniSwitch

The Alcatel-Lucent OmniSwitch Vendor-Specific-Attributes (VSA) run as "Vendor ID" 800, hence you'll have to use the "XYLAN" dictionary.

The products run the "Alcatel-Lucent Operating System" (AOS) in two major release trees.

Note: Not all features are shared/available across the product lines, I'll do my best to pin-point what works in which release!

**AOS Release 6**
* AOS Release 6.4.x
** OmniSwitch 6850E
** OmniSwitch 6855
* AOS Release 6.6.x
** OmniSwitch 6250
** OmniSwitch 6450
 
**AOS Release 7**
* AOS Release 7.3.2.R01
** OmniSwitch 6900
** OmniSwitch 10K

### Authenticated Switch Access (ASA)

If you want to access the OmniSwitch via Telnet/SSH/WebView and authenticate the user via Radius, follow the steps below.

By default all access to the switch is limited to "console access" (User: admin, Password: switch)
Except for SSH if the switch obtained an IP address via DHCP, then SSH will be available for initial remote configuration (that is the case below).

    -> show aaa authentication 
    Service type = Default
      Authentication = denied
    Service type = Console 
      1st authentication server  = local
    Service type = Telnet
     Authentication = Use Default,
     Authentication = denied
    Service type = Ftp
     Authentication = Use Default,
     Authentication = denied
    Service type = Http
     Authentication = Use Default,
     Authentication = denied
    Service type = Snmp
     Authentication = Use Default,
     Authentication = denied
    Service type = Ssh
     1st authentication server  = local

**On the switch, configure the following ...**

    -> aaa radius-server freeradius host 192.168.2.103 key verysecret
    -> aaa authentication ssh freeradius local
    -> show aaa server freeradius
    Server name = freeradius
      Server type         = RADIUS,
      IP Address 1        = 192.168.2.103,
      Retry number        = 3,
      Time out (sec)      = 2,
      Authentication port = 1812,
      Accounting port     = 1813

Note: Please don't use "verysecret" as your key, it is just meant as a placeholder!

**On the Radius ...**

**/etc/freeradius/clients.conf**

    client 192.168.2.106/24 {
            secret          = verysecret
            shortname       = OmniSwitch
    }

**/etc/freeradius/users**

To create an admin account that has full read-write privileges is straight forward:

     admin           Cleartext-Password := "password"
                     Xylan-Asa-Access = "all",
                     Xylan-Acce-Priv-F-W1 = 0xFFFFFFFF,
                     Xylan-Acce-Priv-F-W2 = 0xFFFFFFFF

Now let us assume you want to create an "read-only" user that can see all aspects of the configuration.

(This is the **bad** example! Showcasing the most common mistake ...)

    readadmin       Cleartext-Password := "password"
                    Xylan-Asa-Access = "all",
                    Xylan-Acce-Priv-R1 = 0xFFFFFFFF,
                    Xylan-Acce-Priv-R2 = 0xFFFFFFFF

If you just use the configuration above, you'll see the following error message:

    Benny$ ssh readadmin@192.168.2.106
    readadmin's password for keyboard-interactive method: 
     
    PTY allocation request failed on channel 0

Instead the entry needs to look like this:

    readadmin       Cleartext-Password := "password"
                    Xylan-Asa-Access = "all",
                    Xylan-Acce-Priv-F-R1 = 0xFFFFFFFF,
                    Xylan-Acce-Priv-F-R2 = 0xFFFFFFFF,
                    Xylan-Acce-Priv-F-W1 = 0x00000002,
                    Xylan-Acce-Priv-F-W2 = 0x00000000

The result should look like this:

    Benny$ ssh readadmin@192.168.2.106
    readadmin's password for keyboard-interactive method:

Although we just want to give "read-only" access to the OmniSwitch, we'll need to allow "read-write" for the access method, in this case SSH. The domains/command family values are simply added to the read-only or read-write entries.

You can get the values for the various commands/domains either via the CLI or by using the "Bitmap Calculator" that is accessible through the WebView of the AOS.

    -> show aaa priv hexa ssh telnet
    0x0000000a 0x00000000

The first value goes in R1/W1 and the second value in R2/W2, pretty easy (if you once figured it out).
The advantage is that at login the "allowed set of commands" is known by the switch without any further interaction with the Radius during the session.

As you can see above, you can do the calculation on the switch as well if you provide the commands/domains.

That said, a read-only user for all domains with SSH + Telnet access would look like this:

        readadmin       Cleartext-Password := "password"
                        Xylan-Asa-Access = "all",
                        Xylan-Acce-Priv-F-R1 = 0xFFFFFFFF,
                        Xylan-Acce-Priv-F-R2 = 0xFFFFFFFF,
                        Xylan-Acce-Priv-F-W1 = 0x0000000A,
                        Xylan-Acce-Priv-F-W2 = 0x00000000

Please don't forget that you'll have to add the following command on your OmniSwitch if you want Telnet to query the Radius.

    -> aaa authentication telnet freeradius local 

### MAC-ADDRESS Authentication (aka non-supplicant authentication)
Read this if you want to authenticate MAC-ADDRESSES through the Radius server.

**On OmniSwitch:**

    -> aaa radius-server "freeradius" host 192.168.2.103 key verysecret
    -> vlan port mobile 1/2
    -> vlan port 1/2 802.1x enable 
    -> aaa authentication 802.1x freeradius
    -> aaa authentication mac freeradius

The OmniSwitch created the following template automatically for you:

    -> show configuration snapshot aaa
    ...
    ! 802.1x :
    802.1x 1/2 direction both port-control auto quiet-period 60 tx-period 30 supp-timeout 30 server-timeout 30 max-req 2 re-authperiod 3600 no reauthentication
    802.1x 1/2 captive-portal session-limit 12 retry-count 3 
    802.1x 1/2 supp-polling retry 2 
    802.1x 1/2 captive-portal inactivity-logout disable
    802.1x 1/2 supplicant policy authentication pass group-mobility default-vlan fail block
    802.1x 1/2 non-supplicant policy block
    802.1x 1/2 captive-portal policy authentication pass default-vlan fail block

This is a secure (802.1x enabled) starting point, but we want to look at MAC-ADDRESS (non-supplicant) authentication first.

    -> 802.1x 1/2 non-supplicant policy authentication pass default-vlan fail block 

It is important to note the "policy authentication" keyword, as otherwise the MAC-ADDRESS will not be sent for verification to the Radius. In case of success we'll place the user in default-vlan, if not block.

If you now connect your workstation to the port, you'll see a request like the following at the Radius

    rad_recv: Access-Request packet from host 192.168.2.106 port 1028, id=6, length=76
	User-Name = "001EECAAAAAA"
	User-Password = "001EECAAAAAA"
	NAS-IP-Address = 192.168.2.106
	NAS-Port = 1002
	NAS-Port-Type = Ethernet
	Service-Type = Call-Check

Note that the OmniSwitch sends the MAC-ADDRESS in UPPERCASE for username/password.
TODO: Document how to change that... (it is possible)

In case that the authentication failed, you can verify the same on AOS CLI:

    -> show 802.1x non-supplicant 
    
    Slot  MAC               MAC Authent      Classification      Vlan      
    Port  Address           Status           Policy              Learned   
    -----+-----------------+----------------+-------------------+--------
    01/02 00:1e:ec:aa:aa:aa Failed           Basic-Blk           1 

Now we add an entry to the /etc/freeradius/users for that MAC-ADDRESS:

    001EECAAAAAA    Cleartext-Password := "001EECAAAAAA"
    
The authentication should now be successful, verify like this:

    -> show 802.1x non-supplicant 
    
    Slot  MAC               MAC Authent      Classification      Vlan      
    Port  Address           Status           Policy              Learned   
    -----+-----------------+----------------+-------------------+--------
    01/02 00:1e:ec:aa:aa:aa Authenticated    Basic-Dft VLAN      1 
    
Now let us assume that you want to place the user in a different VLAN (Dynamic VLAN Assignment) via Radius.
There are two ways to do that ... (VLAN 20 is our plan)

1.) Use the Vendor-Specific-Attribute (Xylan-Auth-Group)

The entry in /etc/freeradius/users for that MAC-ADDRESS should look like this:

    001EECAAAAAA    Cleartext-Password := "001EECAAAAAA"
                    Xylan-Auth-Group = 20

The following looks good ...

    Sending Access-Accept of id 22 to 192.168.2.106 port 1029
	Xylan-Auth-Group = 20

Here is the confirmation:

    -> show 802.1x non-supplicant 
    
    Slot  MAC               MAC Authent      Classification      Vlan      
    Port  Address           Status           Policy              Learned   
    -----+-----------------+----------------+-------------------+--------
    01/02 00:1e:ec:aa:aa:aa Authenticated    Basic-Auth Svr      20 

2.) Use the standardised way (IEEE)

The entry in /etc/freeradius/users for that MAC-ADDRESS should look like this:

    001EECAAAAAA    Cleartext-Password := "001EECAAAAAA"
                    Tunnel-Medium-Type = IEEE-802,
                    Tunnel-Type = VLAN,
                    Tunnel-Private-Group-ID = 20

The following looks good ...

    Sending Access-Accept of id 23 to 192.168.2.106 port 1029
	Tunnel-Medium-Type:0 = IEEE-802
	Tunnel-Type:0 = VLAN
	Tunnel-Private-Group-Id:0 = "20"

Here is the confirmation:

    -> show 802.1x non-supplicant 
    
    Slot  MAC               MAC Authent      Classification      Vlan      
    Port  Address           Status           Policy              Learned   
    -----+-----------------+----------------+-------------------+--------
    01/02 00:1e:ec:aa:aa:aa Authenticated    Basic-Auth Svr      20

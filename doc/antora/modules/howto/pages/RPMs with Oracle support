If you wish to use Oracle you will need to recompile FreeRADIUS on a machine 
that has Oracle development libraries installed. FreeRADIUS is known to work both with a full Oracle installation as well as with the Oracle Instant Client SDK(http://www.oracle.com/technology/tech/oci/instantclient/index.html). Once built the resulting RPM package can be deployed with just the Oracle Instant Client(http://www.oracle.com/technology/tech/oci/instantclient/index.html) (No need for the SDK on production machines)

Most rpm packages available do not included oraclesql.conf due to the fact that they also don't contain the Oracle driver module (due to copyright restrictions).

If you have the Oracle header files in a sane location it should be a simple matter of taking the latest FreeRADIUS release tarball and 
dropping it in ``/usr/src/packages/SOURCES`` along with the other files from the ``suse/`` or ``redhat/`` directory inside the tarball with the exception of ``freeradius.spec`` which goes in ``/usr/src/packages/SPECS``

Then edit ``/usr/src/packages/SPECS/freeradius.spec`` and change:

----
%define _oracle_support 0
----

to:

----
%define _oracle_support 1
----

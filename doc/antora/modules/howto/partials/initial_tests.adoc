Testing authentication is simple. Edit the `users` file (in v3 this has
been moved to `raddb/mods-config/files/authorize`), and add the
following line of text at the top of the file, before anything else:

    testing Cleartext-Password := "password"

Start the server in debugging mode (`radiusd -X`), and run `radtest`
from another terminal window:

    $ radtest testing password 127.0.0.1 0 testing123

You *should* see the server respond with an `Access-Accept`. If it
doesn't, the debug log will show why. In version 2, you can paste the
output into the [debug form](http://networkradius.com/freeradius-debugging/),
and a colorized HTML version will be produced. In version 3, the
output will already be colorized in the terminal. Look for red or
yellow text, and read the relevant messages. They should describe
exactly what went wrong, and how to fix the problem.

If you do see an `Access-Accept`, then *congratulations*, the following
authentication methods now work for the `testing` user:

    PAP, CHAP, MS-CHAPv1, MS-CHAPv2, PEAP, EAP-TTLS, EAP-GTC, EAP-MD5.

The next step is to add more users, and to configure databases. Those
steps are outside of the scope of this short web page, but the general
method to use is important, and is outlined in the next section.

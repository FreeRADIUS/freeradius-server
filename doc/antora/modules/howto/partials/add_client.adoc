When we discuss clients, we mean clients of the RADIUS server, e.g.
wireless access point, network switch or other form of NAS. NOT the
network clients - such as laptops, tablets etc - they do not talk
directly to the RADIUS server.

The above test runs `radtest` from localhost. It is useful to add a new
client, which can be done by editing the `clients.conf` file. Add the
following content:

    client new {
        ipaddr = 192.0.2.1
        secret = testing123
    }

You should change the IP address `192.0.2.1` to be the address of the
client which will be sending `Access-Request` packets.

The client should also be configured to talk to the RADIUS server, by
using the IP address of the machine running the RADIUS server. The
client must use the same secret as configured above in the `client`
section.

Then restart the server in debugging mode, and run a simple test using
the `testing` user. You should see an `Access-Accept` in the server
output

server. Following them lets you create complex configurations with a
minimum of effort. Failure to follow them leads to days of frustration
and wasted effort.*

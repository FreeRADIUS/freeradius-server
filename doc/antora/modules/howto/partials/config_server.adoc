=Configure Server

Changing the server configuration should be done via the following
steps:

1.  Start with a "known working" configuration, such as supplied by the
    default installation.
2.  Make one *small* change to the configuration files.
3.  Start the server in debugging mode with `radiusd -X`.
4.  Verify that the results are what you expect
    -   The debug output shows any configuration changes you have made.
    -   Databases (if used) are connected and operating.
    -   Test packets are accepted by the server.
    -   The debug output shows that the packets are being processed as
        you expect.
    -   The response packets are contain the attributes you expect
        to see.

5.  If everything is OK, save a copy of the configuration, go back to
    step (2), and make another change.
6.  If anything goes wrong,
    -   double-check the configuration;
    -   read the *entire* debug output, looking for words like `error`
        or `warning`. These messages usually contain descriptions of
        what went wrong, and suggestions for how it can be fixed.
        See xref:ROOT:debugging/radiusd_X.adoc[an explanation of the debug output]
    -   try replacing your configuration with a saved copy of a "known
        working" configuration, and start again. This process can clean
        up errors caused by temporary edits, or edits that you have
        forgotten about;
    -   ask for help on the
        http://freeradius.org/support/[freeradius-users] mailing
        list. Include a description of what you are trying to do, and
        the *entire debugging output*, especially output showing the
        server receiving and processing test packets. You may want to
        scrub "secret" information from the output before posting it
        (shared secrets, passwords, etc).

The default server configuration should be tested via the following
command:

[source,shell]
----
radiusd -XC
----

If the configuration is correct, then the server will print the
following message:

[source,log]
----
Configuration appears to be OK
----

If that message does not appear, then it is necessary to correct any
and all errors before proceeding to the next step.  It is a good idea
to ensure that the current configuration works _before_ making changes
to it.

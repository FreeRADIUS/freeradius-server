= The ENUM keyword

.Syntax
----
ENUM <name> <type>
----

.Description
The `ENUM` keyword defines a name for set of xref:dictionary/value.adoc[VALUE]s.

<name>:: The name of the enum.
+
These names are in the same namespace as
xref:dictionary/attribute.adoc[ATTRIBUTE]s, and must follow the same name format.

<type>:: A xref:type/index.adoc[data type]
+
The list of allowed data types are the same as for xref:dictionary/value.adoc[VALUE].

Once an `ENUM` is defined, it can have
xref:dictionary/value.adoc[VALUE]s associated with it, just like with
xref:dictionary/attribute.adoc[ATTRIBUTE]s.

The main purpose of `ENUM` is to define commonly used values in one
place, and then refer to those values from multiple places.  This
reuse simplifies the dictionaries, and helps to avoid errors.

In the following example, `Ethernet-Type` is defined as an `ENUM` and
given xref:dictionary/value.adoc[VALUE]s.  We then define two
xref:dictionary/attribute.adoc[ATTRIBUTE]s, and copy those
xref:dictionary/value.adoc[VALUE]s from the `ENUM` to the
xref:dictionary/attribute.adoc[ATTRIBUTE].

After these definitions, when the server will allow `Some-Protocol` to
be assigned the value `IPv4`, which will get encoded into a packet as
the 16-bit field `0x0800.

.Example
----
ENUM Ethernet-Type uint16
VALUE Ethernet-Type IPv4 0x0800
VALUE Ethernet-Type IPv6 0x86DD

ATTRIBUTE Some-Protocol 2112 uint16 enum=Ethernet-Type
ATTRIBUTE Other-Thing  6809 uint16 enum=Ethernet-Type

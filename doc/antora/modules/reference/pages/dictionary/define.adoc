= The DEFINE keyword

.Syntax
----
DEFINE <name> <type> [<flags>]
----

.Description

The `DEFINE` keyword defines a name and data type mapping for
attributes which do not have numbers associated with them.  These
attributes are generally not sent in any protocol, or the underlying
protocol is string-based, and not binary-packed data.

<name>:: The name of the attribute.  The name can contain alphanumeric
characters, `-`, and `_`.  The name should be short and descriptive.
+
The name of this `DEFINE` is defined only within the context of its
parent attribute.

<type>:: A xref:type/index.adoc[data type].

<flags>:: The flag field is optional, and is usually protocol-specific.  See
the xref:dictionary/flags.adoc[FLAGS] page for definitions of common
flags.
+
Please see the protocol dictionaries for examples of these flags.
Only the flags which are used in a protocol dictionary are valid,
and those flags are only valid for that protocol dictionary.

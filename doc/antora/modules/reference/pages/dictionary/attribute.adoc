= The ATTRIBUTE keyword

.Syntax
----
ATTRIBUTE <name> <number> <type> [<flags>]
----

.Description
The `ATTRIBUTE` keyword defines a name, number, and data type mapping.

<name>:: The name of the attribute.  The name can contain alphanumeric
characters, `-`, and `_`.  The name should be short and descriptive.
+
As the names are hierarchical, the name is scoped to its parent.  So
the name `Counter` can mean different things, depending on its
context.

<number>:: The number of the attribute.  Numbers can be specified as
decimal (`19`), or as hex (`0xffee`).
+
Numbers can also be specified as object identifiers (OIDs), `26.1.9`,
or as partial OIDs (`.14`).
+
There are a number of complex rules and interpretations of OID values
which are difficult to clearly document using simple examples.  This
complex behavior is only needed for rare situations.  In short, if you
are creating complex protocol dictionaries, you need to understand
those protocols before creating the dictionaries.  On the other hand,
if you are creating simple protocol dictionaries, there is no need to
understand any complex rules around the use of OIDs.

<type>:: A xref:type/index.adoc[data type]
+
A few data types can be marked up as being fixed size, by adding an
"array-style" suffix, such as with `octets[3]`.  See below for details.

<flags>:: The flag field is optional, and is usually protocol-specific.  See
the xref:dictionary/flags.adoc[FLAGS] page for definitions of common
flags.
+
Please see the protocol dictionaries for examples of these flags.
Only the flags which are used in a protocol dictionary are valid,
and those flags are only valid for that protocol dictionary.
+
The old-style RADIUS syntax of specifying a vendor name in the `flags`
field is not supported.

Common flags and meanings
[options="header"]
[cols="30%,70%"]
|=====
| Name           | Description
| `array`        | For fixed-size types, declare that the contents of the packet can have an array of this value.
| `clone=<ref>`  | For `tlv` or 'struct' types, clone (or copy) child definitions from another attribute of the same type
| `concat`       | For `octet` data types, the server will automatically split/merge values into attributes.
| `counter`      | For numeric data types, treat the values as SNMP-style counters, which can be automatically added.
| `enum=<ref>`   | For "leaf" types, copy xref:dictionary/value.adoc[VALUE]s from an xref:dictionary/enum.adoc[ENUM] or other attribute.
| `internal`     | This attribute is internal to the server, and will never be sent "on the wire"
| `ref=<ref>`    | For `group` types, the referenced attributes will be allowed in the group
| `secret`       | The server will not print `secret` values in debug mode, and in many other situations.
|=====

See the the xref:dictionary/reference.adoc[reference] page for the syntax of references in the dictionary.

.Examples
----
ATTRIBUTE Foo 1 string[3]
ATTRIBUTE Bar 2 octets
ATTRIBUTE baz 3 ipv4addr

== Fixed Size Data types

Some following data types can be marked up as having fixed size, by
using an array suffix, e.g. `octets[14]`.

Fixed Size types and meanings
[options="header"]
[cols="30%,70%"]
|=====
| Type         | Description
| `octets[n]`  | Declare that this attribute uses `n` bytes of `octets` data
| `string[n]`  | Declare that this attribute uses `n` bytes of `string` data
| `struct[n]`  | Declare that this structure uses `n` bytes for itself, including all child xref:dictionary/member.adoc[MEMBER]s

= The PROTOCOL keyword

.Syntax
----
PROTOCOL <name> <value> [<option>]
----

.Description

The `PROTOCOL` keyword defines a new top-level protocol such as `RADIUS`, `DHCPv4`, etc.


<name>:: The name of the protocol

<value>:: A number associated with the protocol.
+
These numbers have no meaning outside of FreeRADIUS, and are assigned by the FreeRADIUS developers.

<option>:: The only supported option is `verify=lib`.
+
The option tells the server to load a dynamic library
``libfreeradius-``_<name>_.  It then uses special callbacks in that
library to verify the contents of the protocol dictionary.

The `PROTOCOL` keyword is documented for completeness, but it should
only be used by the FreeRADIUS developers.

.Examples
----
PROTOCOL RADIUS 1 verify=lib

= The MEMBER keyword

.Syntax
----
MEMBER <name> <type> [<flags>]
----

.Description

The `MEMBER` keyword defines a name and data type mapping for members
of a parent xref:dictionary/struct.adoc[STRUCT] definition.  The definitions
preceding a `MEMBER` must be either another `MEMBER`, or be a `STRUCT`.

<name>:: The name of the attribute.  The name can contain alphanumeric
characters, `-`, and `_`.  The name should be short and descriptive.
+
The name of this `MEMBER` is defined only within the context of its parent `STRUCT`.

<type>:: A xref:type/index.adoc[data type], or the special type `bit`.
+
A few data types can be marked up as being fixed size, by adding an
"array-style" suffix, such as with `bit[3]`.  See below for details.

NOTE: Only `MEMBER` definitions can contain `bit` fields.  While `bit`
fields do not have to start and end on byte boundaries, changing from
a non-`bit` type to a `bit` type (and vice-versa) can only be done on
a byte boundary.

<flags>:: The flag field is optional, and is usually protocol-specific.  See
the xref:dictionary/flags.adoc[FLAGS] page for definitions of common
flags.
+
Please see the protocol dictionaries for examples of these flags.
Only the flags which are used in a protocol dictionary are valid,
and those flags are only valid for that protocol dictionary.
+
The `key` flag can only be used for ``MEMBER``s where the data type is `uint8`, `uint16`, or `uint32`.

Common flags and meanings
[options="header"]
[cols="30%,70%"]
|=====
| Name         | Description
| `array`      | For fixed-size types, declare that the contents of the packet can have an array of this value.
| `enum=...`   | For "leaf" types, copy xref:dictionary/value.adoc[VALUE]s from an `xref:dictionary/enum.adoc[ENUM].
| `clone=...`  | For `tlv` or 'struct' types, clone (or copy) child definitions from another attribute of the same type
| `key`        | This member is a "key" type.  The struct can have different xref:dictionary/struct.adoc[STRUCT] children depending on the value of the key.
|=====

See the the xref:dictionary/reference.adoc[reference] page for the syntax of references in the dictionary.

.Examples
----
STRUCT Foo
MEMBER Bar  bit[3]
MEMBER Baz  bit[5]
MEMBER Name string

== Fixed Size Data types

The following data types can be marked up as having fixed size, by
using an array suffix, e.g. `octets[14]`.

Fixed Size types and meanings
[options="header"]
[cols="30%,70%"]
|=====
| Keyword | Description
| `bit[n]`     | Declare that this attribute uses `n` bits, treated as an unsigned integer
| `octets[n]`  | Declare that this attribute uses `n` bytes of `octets` data
| `string[n]`  | Declare that this attribute uses `n` bytes of `string` data

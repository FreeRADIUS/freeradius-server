= Why FreeRADIUS is different

The creation of policies is what makes FreeRADIUS different from other
products just as DNS or DHCP servers.  With some artistic license, we
can say that those products are much simpler to configure than
FreeRADIUS.

This simplicity comes not from the choice of implementation, where
those products have chosen to make themselves easy to configure, and
FreeRADIUS has chosen to be difficult.  Instead, the simplicity comes
largely from how the protocols work.

If we over-simplify DNS, we can say that the bulk of DNS traffic is
queries like "please tell me the IP address of `google.com` ", with
responses containing addresses such as `8.8.8.8`.  For those
situations, a simple configuration format is best.  A DNS "zone" file
can contain a simple mapping between names and IP addresses.  That
mapping can then serve the needs of most users.

Similar arguments can be made for DHCP.  Most DHCP queries are of the
form "here's my MAC, can I please get an IP address?".  The responses
are then "here's your IP, gateway, netmask, and expiry time".  A DHCP
configuration file can then be little more than defining a range of
IPs, along with associated gateway and netmask.

This is not to say that all DNS and DHCP configuration is trivial,
it's not.  The protocols can be complicated, which leads to complex
configurations.  However, the bulk of what most people want to do is
relatively simple.

That is not always the case for RADIUS.

With RADIUS, it is true that basic configuration is simple.  For
example, policies such as "I have users in LDAP, and I want
authenticated users to access the network".  For this policy, the
administrator configures the xref:reference:raddb/mods-available/ldap.adoc[LDAP]
module, adds some xref:reference:raddb/clients.conf.adoc[client] definitions,
and _everything just works_.

The problem comes when people need policies like "allow users onto the
network for six hours, except for alternate Tuesdays between 9am and
5pm, where they can get on the network for 8 hours".  While this
example is contrived, the underlying complexity is realistic.

This last piece is what makes FreeRADIUS difficult to configure.  The
issue is not FreeRADIUS, the complexity comes from the differences in
_configuration styles_.

For DNS, DHCP, and simple RADIUS policies, the configuration is
*declarative*.

A declarative configuration is where you declare what you want, such
as "`google.com` has IP address `8.8.8.8`", and the server just "does
the right thing".  There is no need to design complex policies, the
declaration that `google.com==8.8.8.8` is enough for the server to
know what to do.

For complex RADIUS policies, the configuration is *procedural*.

i.e. programming.

Outside of esoteric languages and research projects, it is not
possible to simply "declare" what you want, and have the computer
"figure it out".  Even if that does work, the solution may be
inefficient and therefore unusable.  Or the effort required to create
a complex "declaration" may be no easier then effort required to
simply program a procedural solution.

In the end, the difficulty of configuring FreeRADIUS comes in part
from the procedural nature of the `unlang` configuration language.
The remainder of the difficulty is almost always because of poorly
specified requirements.

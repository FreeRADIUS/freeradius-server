= The break statement

.Syntax
[source,unlang]
----
break
----

The `break` statement is used to exit an enclosing
xref:unlang/foreach.adoc[foreach] loop or a
xref:unlang/case.adoc[case] statement.  The `break` statement cannot
be used in any other location.

In this example, a `break` is used to exit a
xref:unlang/foreach.adoc[foreach] loop when a particular condition
matches.

.Example of break within foreach
[source,unlang]
----
foreach i (Class) {
    if (i == 0xabcdef) {
        break
    }

    reply += {
        Reply-Message = "Contains %{i}"
    }
}
----

In the next example, a `break` is used to exit a
xref:unlang/case.adoc[case] statement, which then also exits the
parent xref:unlang/switch.adoc[switch] statement

.Example of break within case / switch
[source,unlang]
----
switch User-Name {
    case 'bob' {
        if (NAS-IP-Address == 192.0.2.1) {
            break
        }
        
        reject
    }

    default {
        ok
    }
}

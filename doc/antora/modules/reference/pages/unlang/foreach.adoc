= The foreach Statement

.Syntax
[source,unlang]
----
foreach [<key-type> <key-name>,] [<value-type>] <value-name> (<reference>) {
    [ statements ]
}
----

The `foreach` statement loops over values given in `<reference>`.
Each value is assigned to the given loop variable.  If the loop is
done over attributes, it is also possible to get a reference to the
current attribute, either as a string reference, or an integer index.

The loop can be exited early by using the
xref:unlang/break.adoc[break] keyword.

There is no limit to how many `foreach` statements can be nested.

<key-type>::

The `<key-type>` and `<key-name>` fields are optional.  But if used,
both must be specified.

The `<key-type>` is the data type for the key or index variable.  The data type can be numeric (e.g. `uint32`) for a `<reference>` which is a dynamic expansion or attribute reference.  The data type can be `string` for an attribute reference.

<key-name>::

The local variable where the key refereence is placed.

For numerical data types, the key value starts off at zero (0), and
increases by one every round through the loop.  For `string` data
types the key value is the full path to the current attribute.

The `<key-type>` and `<key-name>` are optional, and can be omitted.

A `<key-name>` must not be an `unlang` keyword, a module name, or
the name of an existing attribute.

<value-type>::

An optional data type for the `<value-name>` local variable.  It must be a 'leaf' data type like `uint32`, or `string`, or `ipv4addr`.  Structural data types like `group` or `tlv` are not allowed.

When looping over attributes, the `<value-type>` can be omitted.  The
data type of the local variable is then taken automatically from the
attribute reference.

When looping over data returned from a dynamic expansion, the
`<value-type>` can sometimes be determined from the expansion.
e.g. `%range(...)` returns a `uint32`.  However, if the `<value-type>`
cannot be automatically determined, then an error will be produced.

If the `<value-type>` is specified, it has to be compatible with the
data type produced by the `<reference>`.  That is, the data types can
be different, but it must be possible to cast one data type to another.

<value-name>::

The name of the local variable which is used to store the current value when iterating over the attributes.

The local variable is created automatically when the `foreach` loop is
entered, and is deleted automatically when the `foreach` loop exits.

The `<value-name>` can be modified during the course of the `foreach`
loop.  Modifications to the variable do not result in immediate
changes being made to any attribute being looped over.  Instead, the
value is copied back to the attribute at the end of each loop
iteration.

A `<value-name>` must not be an `unlang` keyword, a module name, or
the name of an existing attribute.  A `<value-name>` can be reused in
different sections.

<reference>::

An xref:unlang/attr.adoc[attribute reference] which will will be looped
over.  The reference can be to one attribute, to an array, a child, or
be a subset of attributes.

Alternatively, the `<reference>` can be a
xref:reference:xlat/index.adoc[dynamic expansion function], such as
`%sql("SELECT ...")`.  When the reference is a dynamic expansion
function, a `<value-type>` usually needs to be specified.

There is currently no way to assign _sets_ of results to a value.
That is, an SQL query can return a list of strings or IP addresses,
but it cannot return a series of rows, each of which contains a number
of columns.

== Attributes Being Looped over

While it is technically possible to modify the attributes being looped
over, any modifications are over-written at the end of each loop.

Instead, any modifications should be done to the loop variable.

It is not possible to delete the attributes being looped over.

.Example of modifying values
[source,unlang]
----
Tmp-Integer-0 := { 1, 3, 5, 11 }

foreach self (Tmp-Integer-0) {
	self += 19
}
----

Once the loop has finished , the `Tmp-Integer-0` attribute will have
the following set of values.

[source,unlang]
----
Tmp-Integer-0 := { 20, 22, 24, 30 }
----

.Pseudocode for variable modification
----
loop over each i in attribute[0..n]
    copy / cast attribute[i] to <value-name>

    run loop body

    copy / cast <value-name> back to attribute[i]
----

=== Keys

Using a key variable allows the loop to determine exactly which
attribute is being modified.  Or else, which of `0..n` values are
being examined.

For attributes, the `<key-type>` must be `string` or `uint32`.  When
the `string` data type is used, a reference to the attribute is placed
into the string value.  e.g. `reply.Reply-Message[3]` When the
`uint32` data type is used, the index to the current loop iteration is
placed into the value, e.g. `3`.

For dynamic expansions, The `<key-type> must be a numerical type such
as `uint32`.  The index to the current loop iteration is placed into
the value at the beginning of each loop iteration.

.Key variable with attribute reference
[source,unlang]
----
string total
Tmp-Integer-0 := { 1, 3, 5, 11 }

foreach string ref, uint32 self (Tmp-Integer-0) {
	total += ref
	total += " = "
	total += (string) self
	total += ", "
}
----

When the loop is finished, the `total` variable will have the following value:

----
"Tmp-Integer-0[0] = 1, "Tmp-Integer-0[1] = 3, "Tmp-Integer-0[2] = 5, "Tmp-Integer-0[3] = 11, "
----

.Key variable with attribute index
[source,unlang]
----
string total
Tmp-Integer-0 := { 1, 3, 5, 11 }

foreach uint32 index, uint32 self (Tmp-Integer-0) {
	...
}
----


A dynamic expansion can use a keyed index.  If the `SELECT` statement
below returns a list of `"a", "b", "c", "d"`. then we have the
following example:

.Key variable with expansion
[source,unlang]
----
string total

foreach uint32 index, string data (%sql("SELECT ...") {
	total += (string) index
	total += ":"
	total += data
	ttoal += ", "
}
----

When the loop is finished, the `total` variable will have the following value:

----
"0:a, 1:b, 2:c, 3:d, "
----

=== Structural Data Types

It is possible to loop over the children of a structural data type, as
given in the example below.  Since the loop is over the child
(i.e. leaf) attributes, the values are copied back as described above.

In this example, we have to explicitly give a data type of `string`.  The
data type is needed because there may be multiple children of the
`TLV-Thing` attribute, and the children may not all have the same data
type.

.Example of Looping over children of a structural type.
[source,unlang]
----
foreach string child (TLV-Thing.[*]) {
	out += child
	out += " "
}
----

When using `foreach` to loop over differnet data types, the values can
be examined, but cannot be changed.  This is a limitation of the
current interpreter, and may be changed in the future.

.Example of Looping over children of a structural type.
[source,unlang]
----
foreach thing (Tmp-TLV-0[*]) {
	out += thing.c
	out += " "
}
----

This example can read the child attribute `c`, but cannot modify it.

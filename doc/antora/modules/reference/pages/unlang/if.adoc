= The if Statement

.Syntax
[source,unlang]
----
if (condition) {
    [ statements ]
}
----

.Description
The `if` statement evaluates a xref:condition/index.adoc[condition].  When the
_condition_ evaluates to `true`, the statements within the subsection
are executed.  When the _condition_ evaluates to `false`, those
statements are skipped.

An `if` statement can optionally be followed by an xref:unlang/else.adoc[else] or
an xref:unlang/elsif.adoc[elsif] statement.

.Example
[source,unlang]
----
if (&User-Name == "bob") {
    reject
}

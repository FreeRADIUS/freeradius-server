= The if Statement

.Syntax
[source,unlang]
----
if <condition> {
    [ statements ]
}
----

.Description
The `if` statement evaluates a xref:unlang/condition/index.adoc[condition].  When the
_<condition>_ evaluates to `true`, the statements within the subsection
are executed.  When the _<condition>_ evaluates to `false`, those
statements are skipped.

An `if` statement can optionally be followed by an xref:unlang/else.adoc[else] or
an xref:unlang/elsif.adoc[elsif] statement.

.Example
[source,unlang]
----
if (User-Name == "bob") {
    reject
}
----

== Practical Suggestions

There are a number of practical suggestions which make it easier to work with conditions.

=== Brackets are usually optional.

There is no need to put brackets around a _<condition>_.  The following two examples work identically:

.Example With Brackets
[source,unlang]
----
if (User-Name == "bob") {
    reject
}
----

And without:

.Example Without Brackes
[source,unlang]
----
if User-Name == "bob" {
    reject
}
----

The same behavior applies to conditions with complex statements using
`&` and `||`.  So long as the text between the `if` and the `{` is a
valid condition, it will be parsed correctly.

=== Multi-line conditions

A _<condition>_ can span multiple lines.  There is no need to use `\\` at the end of a line.  The following condition is valid:

.Example With Brackets
[source,unlang]
----
if (User-Name ==
     "bob") {
    reject
}
----

=== Actions

The last entry in an `if` section can also be an xref:unlang/actions.adoc[actions] subsection.

= The redundant Statement

.Syntax
[source,unlang]
----
redundant {
    [ statements ]
}
----

The `redundant` section executes a series of statements in sequence.
As soon as one statement succeeds, the rest of the section is skipped.

[ statements ]:: One or more `unlang` commands.  Processing starts
from the first statement in the list.
+
If the selected statement succeeds, then the server stops processing
the `redundant` section. If, however, that statement fails, then the
next statement in the list is chosen.  This process continues until
either one statement succeeds or all of the statements have failed.
+
All of the statements in the list should be modules, and of the same
type (e.g., `ldap` or `sql`). All of the statements in the list should
behave identically, otherwise different requests will be processed
through different modules and will give different results.

In general, we recommend using the
xref:unlang/redundant-load-balance.adoc[redundant-load-balance] statement
instead of `redundant`.

.Example
[source,unlang]
----
redundant {
    sql1
    sql2
    sql3
}
----

== Redundant Sections as Modules

It can be useful to use the same `redundant` section in multiple
places.  Instead of copying the same text multiple times, a
`redundant` section can be defined as a module in the `mods-enabled/`
directory.

For example, the following text can be placed into the file
`mods-enabled/sql_all`.  Once it is there, it can be used as a module
named `sql_all`, and used anywhere a module is allowed to use.

.Example of Redundant SQL module
[source,unlang]
----
redundant sql_all {
    sql1
    sql2
    sql3
}
----

In previous versions of the server, this definition would be placed
into the `instantiate` section of `radiusd.conf.  This configuration
is no longer used, and the `sql_all` definition can just be placed as
a module definition into the `mods-enabled/` directory.

== Redundant Expansions

Modules may be used in a `redundant` section, and modules can register
xref:xlat/index.adoc[dynamic expansions].  It is therefore also useful
to define redundant dynamic expansions.  The good news is that the
server does this automatically.

When a `redundant` section is defined, _and_ where all of the modules
in the `redundant` section reference the same underlying module
(e.g. `sql`, or `ldap`), the server then automatically registers a new
_redundant expansion_, with the name of the `redundant` section.  The
example below shows how this works.

.Example
[source,unlang]
----
redundant sql_all {
	sql1
	sql2
	sql3
}
----

Each `sql` module will register it's own xref:xlat/index.adoc[dynamic
expansions], such as `%sql1(...)`, and `%sql2(...)` and `%sql3(...).
However, there will _also_ be a new SQL expansion defined:

----
%sql_all(...)
----

This is a _redundant_ expansion.  When it is called, it follows
operation of the `redundant` block which defined it.  That is, it will
first run `%sql1(...)`, then if that fails, run `%sql2(...)`, etc.

.Example of Redundant SQL module
[source,unlang]
----
Reply-Message := %sql_all("SELECT message FROM table WHERE name='%{User-Name}'")
----

The one caveat here is that the arguments passed to the underlying
modules are expanded again _for each call_.  If the expansion
arguments have side effects, then those side effects can be applied
multiple times, once for each `redundant` attempt.

=== Additional redundant expansions

Modules can register multiple expansions. If the module's expansion
shares the module's instance name, the redundant expansion is
registered with the `redundant` section name. Otherwise, the redundant
expansion is _qualified_ with the `redundant` section name.

For example, the `sql` module provides two expansions, a self-named
expansion and a `group` expansion.  Using the example from the previous
section, `redundant sql_all {...}` would register the following:

----
%sql_all(...)
%sql_all.group(...)
----

=== Module expansion grouping

Module expansions which share the same name are grouped into the same
redundant expansion.  This may result in only a subset of the module
expansions in a `redundant` section being called by a redundant
expansion.

.Example
[source,unlang]
----
redundant sql_and_ldap {
	sql1
	sql2
	ldap1
    ldap2
}
----

The `sql_and_ldap` redundant section would register the following
expansions:

- `%sql_and_ldap(...)` which would call `%sql1(...)`, `%sql2(...)`, `%ldap1(...)`, and `%ldap2(...)`
- `%sql_and_ldap.group(...)` which would call `%sql1.group(...)`, `%sql2.group(...)`, `%ldap1.group(...)`, `%ldap2.group(...)`
- `%sql_and_ldap.profile(...)` which would call `%ldap1.profile(...)`, `%ldap2.profile(...)`

If the arguments passed to the redundant expansion are not compatible
with _all_ the module expansions it would call, the server will log an
error and either fail to start, or stop processing the expression which
called the redundant expansion.

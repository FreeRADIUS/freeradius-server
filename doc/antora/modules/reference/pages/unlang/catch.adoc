= The catch Statement

.Syntax
[source,unlang]
----
try {
    ...
}
catch [ rcodes ] {
    [ statements ]
}
----

The `catch` statement runs a series of substatements in a block, but only if the previous xref:unlang/try.adoc[try] failed.

[ rcodes ]:: Zero or more module return codes.  The return codes can be `disallow`, `fail`, `invalid`, `timeout`, or `reject`.
+

[ statements ]:: The `unlang` commands which will be executed.  A `catch` block can be empty.

If no rcode is given the `catch` statement matches all of the codes listed above.  Otherwise, the `catch` statement matches one of the listed rcodes.

Multiple `catch` statements can be placed one after the other, to `catch` different errors.  Only one of the statements will be executed.  Once a `catch` statement is finished, the interpreter will skip all trailing `catch` statements, and continue execution

.Example

[source,unlang]
----
try {
    sql           # returns "fail"
}
catch disallow {  # skipped when "fail"
    ...
}

catch fail {
    # ... run only if sql failed

    ok            # over-ride the "fail" code
}

catch invalid {   # skipped after "catch fail" is run.
	...
}
----

There is some overlap in functionality between xref:unlang/try.adoc[try] / `catch` and xref:unlang/redundant.adoc[redundant].  The main difference is that a xref:unlang/catch.adoc[catch] statement can catch specific failure codes.

The xref:unlang/redundant.adoc[redundant] statement should be used to run
one of many similar modules.  For example, the xref:unlang/redundant.adoc[redundant] statement could be used to choose one of four different `sql` modules in a fail-over fashion.

In contrast, the `try` / `catch` statements should be used for more complex policies, when the intention is to run one policy, and then do something completely different if a failure occurs.

The `try` / `catch` statements can also run different statements for each failure code, which is not possible with xref:unlang/redundant.adoc[redundant].

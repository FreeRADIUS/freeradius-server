= The subrequest Statement

.Syntax
[source,unlang]
----
subrequest [<type>] [<request-list>] [<reply-list>] {
    [ statements ]
}
----

The `subrequest` keyword creates a child request.  The child request
typically contains no attributes when it is created.  Attributes in
the child `request` list can be copied from the parent via
xref:unlang/edit.adoc[editing] statements.

Similarly, when a `subrequest` is done, attributes from the child
`reply` list can be copied back to the parent.  Note that this copying
_must_ be done via xref:unlang/edit.adoc[editing] statements, and is
not done automatically by the server.  This behavior is necessary in
order to provide the simplest and most flexible functionality in the
server.

Please see the xref:unlang/list.adoc[list] syntax for a description of
how to refer to parent requests.

The `subrequest` keyword allows the server to receive one type of
packet, and then to create a "child" packet, which can be different
from the parent one.  For example, receive a RADIUS
`Accounting-Request`, and then create a child `Disconnect-Request` to
kick the user offline.  The `subrequest` keyword can also be used to
change protocols.  For example, receive a DHCP `Discover` packet, and
then send a RADIUS `Access-Request` packet to see if the MAC address
is authorized.

The `subrequest` keyword replaces the "pre-proxy", "post-proxy", and
"originate CoA" functionality of v3.  Where v3 had a special syntax
for a small numer of unique cases, v4 provides a general syntax which
is useful in a wide range of situations.

`subrequest` is most commonly used in conjunction with the
xref:unlang/call.adoc[call] keyword to change packet types or
protocols, and then xref:unlang/call.adoc[call] a different virtual
server.  See the "Operation" section below for more information.

<type>:: The packet type of the child request being created.
+
If the _<type>_ field is omitted, then a child request is created
using the same packet type as the current request.
+
If the _<type>_ field contains a protocol reference such as `@dhcpv4`,
then this creates a new child request of a different protocol.  The
rest of the _<type>_ field is then parsed to see what kind of packet
is created.
+
The _<type> field is then parsed as an enumerated packet name such as
`::Access-Request`, Please see the protocol dictionaries for a
complete list of allowed packet types for each protocol.
+
The _<type>_ field cannot be a dynamic expansion.
+
As an exception, the _<type>_ field can be an attribute reference.  When an
attribute reference is used, the attribute must be of an integer type
(8, 16, 32, or 64-bit), or of type `string`.  Integer types are
resolved to known / allowed values of the `Packet-Type` attribute.
String types are resolved to named values for the `Packet-Type`
attribute.
+
When the _<type>_ field is an attribute reference, it is not
possible to change the dictionary.

<request-list>:: A reference to a list of attributes which will be used as the childs request list.
+
It may be omitted, in which case the child request list is empty.  It
can be initialized by manually copying attributes from the parent
+
If the _<request-list>_ is specified, then the _<reply-list>_ must
also be specified.
+
Note that this is a _reference_, and is not a copy.  Updates to the
childs request list will be reflected in the named _<request-list>_.

<reply-list>:: A reference to a list of attributes which will be used as the childs reply list.
+
Note that this is a _reference_, and is not a copy.  Updates to the
childs reply list will be reflected in the named _<reply-list>_.

[ statements ]:: The `unlang` commands which will be executed.

The child request executes the statements inside of the `subrequest`
section.  When the child request has finished execution, it is freed.
The return code of the `subrequest` section is the return code from
the last statement that was executed.

.Example
[source,unlang]
----
subrequest {
	User-Name := parent.request.User-Name
	...
	detail
}
----


== Changing Protocols

The `subrequest` keyword can also be used to change protocols.  For
example, the server can receive a RADIUS `Access-Request`, and then
create a DHCPv4 packet of type `Discover`.  Note that when the
protocol changes, the attributes in the `subrequest` section are
parsed in the context of the new protocol.

.Example
[source,unlang]
----
subrequest @dhcpv4::Discover {
    Your-IP-Address := parent.request.Framed-IP-Address

    ...
}
----

== Operation

The `subrequest` keyword is an generalization of functionality which
was in version 3.  In previous versions of the server, child requests
could be created only via syntax such as `update coa`.  The
`subrequest` keyword is much more powerful than the previous
functionality.  It can be used anywhere, and can create any kind of
packet.

The main purpose of a `subrequest` is to change packet types, or
protocols.  For example, when a user is authenticated it is sometimes
useful to start an accounting session for that user immediately.  In
normal operations, accounting sessions are started when an accounting
packet is received, but those packets may be delayed for seconds, or
may be missing altogether.

The solution to this problem is to start an accounting session
immediately when the user is authenticated.  However, any "ad hoc" way
of starting a session is likely to miss some critical step which is
done for normal accounting packets.  The best approach, then, is to
use the normal accounting process to create the user session.

However, if the incoming packet is `Access-Request`, then it clearly
cannot be used as part of an accounting policy.  The way to solve this
problem is `subrequest`.

When the user is authenticated and the system determines it needs to
start an accounting session for the user, the `unlang` policies can
take the following steps:

* use `subrequest` to create an `Accounting-Request` packet

* use xref:unlang/edit.adoc[edit] statement to populate the `Accounting-Request` with information about the user session

* use xref:unlang/call.adoc[call] to call the server which handles `Accounting-Request` packets.

The result is a policy which cannot ever go wrong.  The fake "start
accounting" packet is run through _exactly the same policies_ as a
normal accounting packet.  There is no way for the real and fake
policies to get out of synchronization, as there is no difference
between the two of them.  There is only one policy for accounting
packets: the real one.

Similar rules can be applied when the server receives
`Accounting-Request` packets.  If the policy decides that the user has
used "too much" data, the server can create a `Disconnect-Request`
packet, and disconnect the users session.

Or, the server can receive a DHCPv4 request, and then send a RADIUS
packet to an external RADIUS server for MAC address authentication.
The combination of `subrequest` and xref:unlang/call.adoc[call] means
that the server can "mix and match" protocols in a way which is
difficult or impossible to do with other protocol servers.

== Subrequests are Synchronous

Execution of the parent request is paused while the child request is
running.  The parent request continues execution once the child request
has finished.

In some cases, it is useful to let the child request continue execution
independently of the parent request.  In the example given above,
sending a `Disconnect-Request` packet may result in a multiple-second
delay the NAS does not respond quickly, due to retransmits.

A child request can be made asynchronous by using the
xref:unlang/detach.adoc[detach] keyword.  Once a child request is detached
from the parent, the parent can continue execution independently of
the child.  However, once a child request is detached from the parent
request, the child can no longer access any attributes in the parent.

See the sections below for more information, including examples.

== Replacing v3 functionality

This section describes how to implement some of the v3 functionality
in v4.

=== Originate CoA

The "originate-coa" functionality in v3 can be replaced by a few lines
of configuration in v4:

.Example Originate a Disconnect-Request Message
[source,unlang]
----
#
#  Create a child Disconnect-Request
#
subrequest ::Disconnect-Request {
    #
    #  Initialize any necessart fields.
    #
    #  Only copy the necessary fields here.  Some NASes
    #  will complain if they see unfamiliar attributes!
    #
    User-Name := parent.request.User-Name
    NAS-IP-Address := parent.request.NAS-IP-Address
    NAS-Port := parent.request.NAS-Port
    Acct-Session-Id := parent.request.Acct-Session-Id

    detach
    radius
}
----

=== Pre-Proxy and Post-Proxy

The `pre-proxy` and `post-proxy` sections can be reimplemented with a
few lines of configuration.

The example shows how to:

* Match a `User-Name` to a domain
* Tell the server to authenticate the user via a specific authentication section
* During authentication, create a subrequest
* populate the child request from the parent request
* run the "radius.example.com" module to proxy the request.  This module should be an instance of the `radius` module.
* after proxying has succeeded (or failed) populate the parent reply from the child reply.

The example shows how a xref:unlang/reference/try.adoc[try] /
xref:unlang/reference/catch.adoc[catch] block can be used to process the different module return codes.

.Example pre-proxy and post-proxy
[source,unlang]
----
recv Access-Request {
    ...
    if (User-Name =~ /example\.com$/) {
        control.Auth-Type := radius.example.com
    }
    ...
}

authenticate radius.example.com {
    subrequest {
        request := parent.request
        # Edit the request here

        try {
            radius.example.com
        }

        # Access-Accept
        catch ok {
            # Edit the reply here
            parent.reply := reply
        }

        # Access-Reject
        catch reject {
            # Edit the reply here
            parent.reply := reply
        }

        # Access-Challenge
        catch updated {
            # Edit the reply here
            parent.reply := reply
        }

        # No reply
        catch fail {
            ...
        }
    }
}

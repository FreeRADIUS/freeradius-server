= The caller Statement

.Syntax
[source,unlang]
----
caller <protocol> {
    [ statements ]
}
----

The `caller` keyword checks the parent request to see if it matches a
particular protocol.  If so, it executes the given _[statements]_, If
the parent does not exist, or the parent protocol does not match, the
statements are ignored.

<protocol>::  The name of the protocol used by the virtual server which `call`ed this policy.

[ statements ]:: If the protocol matches, the _[
statements]_ from inside of the `caller` section will be executed.
These statements will be executed in the context of the current request.

A virtual server may the the target of multiple xref:unlang/call.adoc[call]
keywords, each of which uses a different protocol.  For example, a
policy which handles RADIUS `Access-Request` packets may create a DHCP
`Discover` packet in order to perform IP address allocation.  The DHCP
`Discover` packet will typically be processed through `DHCPv4` virtual
server.  However, that virtual server may need to handle requests
differently based on whether the original packet was RADIUS, or
DHCPv4.

The `caller` keyword allows a virtual server to check where it is
called from, and to apply different policies based on that
information.  The `caller` keywords is in some senses the counter-part
to the xref:unlang/call.adoc[call] keyword.

It may have been possible to use `if` conditions to perform this
check.  However, doing so would involve creating additional syntax
which would not have been as clear as using `caller`.

.Example

This example copies the `Client-Identifer` from the parent DHCPv4
request to the current RADIUS reply packet, as the contents of the
`Filter-Id` attribute.

[source,unlang]
----
caller dhcpv4 {
    update reply {
        &Filter-Id := &parent.request:Client-Identifier
    }
}

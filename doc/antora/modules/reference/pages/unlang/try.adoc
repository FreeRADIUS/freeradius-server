= The try Statement

.Syntax
[source,unlang]
----
try {
    [ statements ]
}
catch [ <return-codes> ] {
    ...
}
catch [ <return-codes> ] {
    ...
}
----

The `try` statement runs a series of substatements in a block.  If the
block returns an error such as `fail`, `reject`, `invalid`,
`disallow`, or `timeout`, a subsequent xref:unlang/catch.adoc[catch]
block is executed.

[ statements ]:: The `unlang` commands which will be executed.  A
`try` block cannot be empty.

Every `try` block must be followed by at least one
xref:unlang/catch.adoc[catch] block.

.Example

[source,unlang]
----
try {
	sql
}
catch fail {
	# ... run only if sql failed

	ok	# over-ride the "fail" code
}
----

There is some overlap in functionality between `try` / xref:unlang/catch.adoc[catch] and xref:unlang/redundant.adoc[redundant].  See the xref:unlang/catch.adoc[catch] documentation for more details.

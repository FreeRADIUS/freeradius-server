= Editing Lists and Attributes

Editing a list or attribute is done by starting an `unlang` policy
line with the `&` character.  This character indicates that the
following text should be interpreted as commands to edit lists and/or
attributes.

.Syntax
[source,unlang]
----
&attribute := <expression>
&attribute = <expression>
&attribute += <expression>
&attribute -= <expression>
...

&list1 := &list2
&list1 += { ... }
...
----

In version 4, the `update` statement has been deprecated.  Using
`update` may still work, but will give warnings.  In addition, the
`update` sections are incapable of dealing with nested attributes, and
will simply not work with them.  We recommend switching to the new
edit syntax, which is more powerful, and less verbose.

An edit statement has the following standard syntax:

.Syntax
[source,unlang]
----
<lhs> <op> <rhs>
----

Where we have:

_<lhs>_:: An xref:reference:unlang/attr.adoc[attribute reference], such as the name of a list or an attribute.

_<op>_:: The operator such as `=`, `:=`, etc.

_<rhs>_:: The value which is assigned to the attribute.  This value
can sometimes be an "in-place" list, in which case it is delimited by
brackets, as in `{...}`.

The _<rhs>_ may be value such as `192.0.2.1, or `5`, or an expression such as `1 + 2`, or `"foo" + "bar"`.

NOTE: Despite the edit statements having syntax similar to `update`
sections, the meaning of the operators have changed significantly.
You _cannot_ convert an `update` section to the new syntax simply by
removing the `update` keyword.

== Atomic "Transactions" and Errors

The edit process is atomic, in that either all of the attributes are
modified, or none of them are modified.  If the edit fails for any
reason, then all of the results are discarded, and the edit does not
affect any attributes.

Note also that the server tracks overflows, underflows, and division
by zero.  These issues are caught, and cause the problematic
calculation to fail.

For example, if an attribute is of type `uint8`, then it can only
contain 8-bit integers.  Any attempt to overflow the value to more
than `255`, or underflow it to lower than zero (`0`), or to divide by
zero, will cause the edit operation to fail.

Nothing bad will happen to the server, it will just encounter a
run-time failure while editing the attribute, and the edit operation
will not succeed.  All other packet processing will continue
processing as normal.

In short, failed edit operations are effectively a "noop" operation,
and do not result in any changes.

=== Grouping Edits

Multiple attributes may be grouped into a set by using the `group`
keyword.  When changes are done in a `group`, then either all of the
changes are applied, or none of them are applied.  This functionality
is best used to conditionally apply attribute changes, generally when
retrieving data from a database.

.Grouping multiple edits
[source,unlang]
----
group {
    &reply.Reply-Message += %(sql:SELECT ...)
    &reply.Filter-Id := "foo"
}
----

If the above SQL `select` statement fails, then then
`&reply.Filter-Id` attribute will not exist.

== List Editing

.Syntax
[source,unlang]
----
&<list> <op> <rhs>
----

List editing can be done for the usual xref:reference:unlang/list.adoc[lists] such as `request`,
`reply`, `control`, etc.  However, as version 4 also supports "nested"
and "grouped" attributes, list editing _also_ applies to nested
attributes.

The operation to be performed depends on the operator, as given in the
table below.  These operations are based on _set theory_, which is a
mathematical system which gives consistency to the operations.  All of
the list operations are simple, and well defined.

.List Editing Operators
[options="header"]
[cols="10%,90%"]
|=====
| Operator | Description
| =        | Set the list to the contents of the _<rhs>_, if the _<list>_ does not exist.  If the list already exists, nothing is done.  If the list does not exist, it is created, and the contents set to the value of the _<rhs>_
| :=       | Override the list to the contents with the _<rhs>_.  If the list already exists, its value is over-written.  If the list does not exist, it is created, and the contents set to thex value of the _<rhs>_
| +=       | Perform list append operation.  The contents of the _<rhs>_ are appended to the _<list>_.  The resulting list is _<list><rhs>_.
| ^=       | Perform a list prepend operation.  The contents of the _<rhs>_ are prepended to the _<list>_.  The resulting list is _<rhs><list>_.
| -=       | Remove attributes from the _<list>_ which match the _<rhs>_ attribute or list.
| \|=       | Perform a list union.  The resulting list has all of the contents of the original _<list>_, and the _<rhs>_ list.
| &=       | Perform a list intersection.  The resulting list has only the attributes which are in both the origianl _<list>_, and the _<rhs>_ list.
| >=       | Perform a priority merge of two lists. The resulting list has all of the contents of the original _<list>_, and of all _<rhs>_ list attributes which are not already in _<list>_.
| \<=       | Perform a priority merge of two lists. The resulting list has all of the contents of the original _<rhs>_, and of all _<list>_ list attributes which are not in _<rhs>_ are left alone..
|=====

Note that operations on lists are generally performed recursively on
sub-lists.  For example, the `\|=` operator will perform the union of
not only two lists, but also will recurse to perform a union of any
sub-lists.

The _<rhs>_ can be a reference to another list (e.g. `request`,
`reply`), or to a nested / grouped attribute.

The _<rhs>_ can also be an "in-place" list, which has syntax similar
to the `update` section.  However, for "in-place" lists, _the only
operator which is permitted is `=`.  The server *will not start* if
any other operator is used._

NOTE: If the right-hand side of an assignment is a list, then _only_
operator allowed inside of the right-hand side list is `=`.

If the _<rhs>_ is an "in-place" list, then all of the
xref:xlat/index.adoc[dynamic expansions] are valid, just as are
xref:reference:unlang/attr.adoc[attribute references].

As a special case, the _<rhs>_ can also be a string, or a
xref:xlat/index.adoc[dynamic expansion].  If so, the string is
interpreted as a set of attribute definitions, as if it was an
"in-place" list.  For example, `"Filter-Id = foo"`

This functionality is complex, so some examples should make this
clearer.

=== Clearing a list

A lists contents can be removed by creating an empty list, and
assigning the empty list to the destination.

.Clearing a list contents, or creating an empty list.
====
[source,unlang]
----
&reply := {}
----
====

In most other contexts, the empty list is ignored.  i.e. Appending an
empty list to `request` does nothing.

=== Adding an attribute to a list

Attributes (or lists of attributes) can be added using the `+=` operator.

The following example appends the `Filter-Id` attribute to the tail of
the `reply` list.  Note again that the operator associated with the
`Filter-Id` attribute is simply `=`.

This operation can best be understood as a two-step process:

1. Create a temporary "in-place" list from the _<rhs>_ of the edit
operation.  This "in-place" list is not associated with any previous
list, but instead exists on its own, independt of anything else.  As
such, there is no need to use operators for the _<rhs>_ list.
Instead, the attributes for this list are created in order, exactly as they are
given.

2. Perform the `+=` ("list append") operation, in which case the
"in-place" list is appended to the `reply` list.

.Appending the `Filter-Id` attribute to the `reply` list
====
[source,unlang]
----
&reply += {
	&Filter-Id = "foo"
}
----
====

As a special case, where the right side is an
xref:reference:unlang/attr.adoc[attribute reference], it is possible
to use `+=`.  In that case, a copy of the referenced attribute is
appended to the list.

.Appending the `User-Name` attribute from the `request` list, to the `reply` list.
====
[source,unlang]
----
&reply += &request.User-Name
----
====


=== Over-riding the contents of a list

The `:=` (override) operator will delete the contents of a list.  We
note that the empty list example above is just a special case of
overriding the contents of a list.

.Set the contents of the `reply` list to the `Filter-Id` attribute.
====
[source,unlang]
----
&reply := {
	&Filter-Id = "foo"
}
----
====

Aftet this operation, the contents of the `reply` list will be one
attribute: `Filter-Id`.

=== Removing attributes from a list

Attributes can be removed from a list using the `-=` (remove) operator.

.Remove the _first_ instance of `Filter-Id` from the `reply` list.
====
[source,unlang]
----
&reply -= &Filter-Id
----
====

.Remove _all_ instances of `Filter-Id` from the `reply` list.
====
[source,unlang]
----
&reply -= &Filter-Id[*]
----
====

.Remove instance of `Filter-Id` which have value `bar`
====
[source,unlang]
----
&reply -= {
    &Filter-Id == "bar"
}
----
====

Multiple attributes can be specified in the _<rhs>_ list.  All
attributes which match the comparison are removed.

This syntax is clearer and more consistent than the old `!* ANY`
hacks.

.List Removal Operators
[options="header"]
[cols="10%,90%"]
|=====
| Operator | Description
| ==       | attributes matching the value exactly
| <        | attributes having value less than the given one
| \<=      | attributes having value less than or equal to the given one
| >        | attributes having value greater than the given one
| >=       | attributes having value greater than or equal to the given one
|=====

For now, regular expression operators are not supported.

=== List to List Operatons

Lists can also be copied using the operators.

.Remove all existing attributes in the `reply` list, and
copies all of the `request` list contents to the `reply` list.
====
[source,unlang]
----
&reply := &request
----
====

.Append the contents of the `request` list to the `reply` list.
====
[source,unlang]
----
&reply += &request
----
====

=== Parsing strings as lists

It is also possible to have strings on the _<rhs>_ of a list
assignment.  This funtionality is most useful for putting attribute
lists into a database, and then reading them back when a request is
processed.

.Assigning attributes taken from a string
====
[source,unlang]
----
&reply += "Filter-Id = 'foo'"
----
====

The above example has the same result as the earlier example of adding
`Filter-Id` to the `reply`, using an "in-place" list.

.Append the contents of the `request` list to the `reply` list.
====
[source,unlang]
----
&reply += "%{sql:SELECT pairs FROM pair_table WHERE username = '%{User-Name}'}"
----
====

In this example, the `pair_table` could contain two columns:
`username` and `pairs`.  The `pairs` column could have free-form text
strings, such as `Filter-Id = "foo"`.

== Attribute Editing

.Syntax
[source,unlang]
----
&<attribute> <op> <rhs>
----

Attribute editing can be done for any
xref:reference:unlang/attr.adoc[attribute] such as
`request.User-Name`, etc.  However, as version 4 also supports
"nested" and "grouped" attributes, attribute editing _also_ can be
done for nested attributes.

The operation to be performed depends on the operator, as given in the
table below.  Unlike the list operations above, attribute operations
change the attribute _value_.

.Attribute Editing Operators
[options="header"]
[cols="10%,90%"]
|=====
| Operator | Description
| =        | Set the attribute to the contents of the _<rhs>_, if the _<attribute>_ does not exist.  If the attribute already exists, nothing is done.  If the attribute does not exist, it is created, and the contents set to the value of the _<rhs>_
| :=       | Delete all existing copies of the named attribute, and create a new attribute with the contents set to the value of the _<rhs>_
| +=       | Perform addition.  The contents of the _<rhs>_ are added to the value of the _<attribute>_.
| -=       | Perform subtraction. The contents of the _<rhs>_ are subtracted from the value of the _<attribute>_.
| *=       | Perform multiplication.  The value of the _<attribute>_ is multiplied by the contents of the _<rhs>_.
| /=       | Perform division. The value of the _<attribute>_ is divided by the contents of the _<rhs>_.
| \|=      | Perform logical "or".  The value of the _<attribute>_ is "or"ed with the contents of the _<rhs>_.
| &=       | Perform logical "and".  The value of the _<attribute>_ is "and"ed with the contents of the _<rhs>_.
| <\<=     | Perform left shift.  The value of the _<attribute>_ is shifted left by the value of _<rhs>_
| >>=      | Perform right shift.  The value of the _<attribute>_ is shifted right by the value of _<rhs>_
|=====

There are also _filtering_operators.  These operators ensure that the
value of the attribute passes the filter.  If the attribute being
checked does not exist, it is created.

.Attribute Filtering Operators
[options="header"]
[cols="10%,90%"]
|=====
| Operator | Description
| <        | Ensure that the _<lhs>_ attribute exists, and has value less than the _<rhs>_
| <=       | Ensure that the _<lhs>_ attribute exists, and has value less than or equal to the _<rhs>_
| >        | Ensure that the _<lhs>_ attribute exists, and has value greater than the _<rhs>_
| >=       | Ensure that the _<lhs>_ attribute exists, and has value greater than than or equal to the _<rhs>_
|=====

The _<rhs>_ can be a reference to another attribute
(e.g. `request.Filter-Id`).  If the field is a double-quoted string,
it undergoes xref:xlat/index.adoc[dynamic expansion], and the resulting
value is processed as described above.

In most cases, the edit operations "do the right thing".  For example,
adding a number to an `ipv4prefix` results in an `ipv4addr` data type.
Similarly, subtracting two 'ipv4addr' data types results in a
numerical value.  Adding a `time_delta` or `integer` to a `date` will
result in a `date`.

=== Operations on `string` and `octet` Data Types

The operators also apply to variable-sized values.

.Attribute Editing Operators for `string` and `octet`
[options="header"]
[cols="10%,90%"]
|=====
| Operator | Description
| =        | Set the attribute to the contents of the _<rhs>_, if the _<attribute>_ does not exist.  If the attribute already exists, nothing is done.  If the attribute does not exist, it is created, and the contents set to the value of the _<rhs>_
| :=       | Override the attribute with the contents with the _<rhs>_.  If the attribute already exists, its value is over-written.  If the attribute does not exist, it is created, and the contents set to thex value of the _<rhs>_
| +=       | Perform string append.  The contents of the _<rhs>_ are appended to the _<attribute>_.
| -=       | Inverse of string append. The contents of the _<rhs>_ are deleted from from the _<attribute>_, if the `_<rhs>_` is a suffix of _<attribute>_ 
| ^=       | For `string`, performs a "prepend" operation.  The contents of the _<rhs>_ are prepended to the _<attribute>_.  This is the opposite of `+=`.
|          | For `octets`, perform logical "xor".  The value of the _<attribute>_ is "or"ed with the contents of the _<rhs>_.  Both strings must be of the same length.
| \|=      | Perform logical "or".  The value of the _<attribute>_ is "or"ed with the contents of the _<rhs>_.  Both strings must be of the same length.
| &=       | Perform logical "and".  The value of the _<attribute>_ is "and"ed with the contents of the _<rhs>_.  Both strings must be of the same length.
| <\<=     | Perform left shift / truncation.  The first _<rhs>_ bytes of _<attribute>_ are dropped. i.e. shifted off of the start of the string.
| >>=      | Perform right shift / truncation.  The last _<rhs>_ bytes of _<attribute>_ are dropped. i.e. shifted off of the end of the string.
|=====

Note that the `^=` operator behaves differently for `string` and
`octets`.  The output of "xor"ing two strings is likely to be binary
data, and therefore not a printable string.  As a result, it is more
useful for strings to have `^=` be a "prepend" operation.

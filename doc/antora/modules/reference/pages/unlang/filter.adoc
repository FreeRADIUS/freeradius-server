= The filter Statement

The `filter` keyword has been removed.  Filtering can now be done with
the new xref:unlang/edit.adoc[edit] syntax.

.Example
[source,unlang]
----
group {
	uint32 small
	uint32 large

	&large = 10000
	&small = 10

	#
	#  Enforce it
	#
	&large <= &small

	# &large now has value '10'

}
----

See the new xref:unlang/edit.adoc[edit] syntax for more details.

= The continue statement

.Syntax
[source,unlang]
----
continue
----

The `continue` statement is used in a
xref:unlang/foreach.adoc[foreach] loop, and will cause the interpret
to skip execution of the rest of the statements in current loop
iteration, and start the next iteration of the loop.  The `continue`
statement cannot be used in any other location.

In this example, a `continue` is used to exit a
xref:unlang/foreach.adoc[foreach] loop when a particular condition
matches.

.Example of continue
[source,unlang]
----
uint32 last

foreach i (%range(10)) {
	if (i < 8) {
		last := i
		continue
	}

	break
}

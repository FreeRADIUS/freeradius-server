= Actions and Return Codes

The xref:unlang/module.adoc[module] syntax allows for the module
return codes to be over-ridden on a per-module basis.  The `actions`
section allows for section return codes to be over-ridden on a
per-section basis.

.Syntax
[source, unlang]
----
actions {
	fail = 1
	ok = handled
	reject = return
	retry {
		max_rtx_time = 1
		max_rtx_count = 3
		max_rtx_duration = 3
	}
}
----

section priority overrides are specified in an `actions` block, which
_must_ be the last thing in a section.  Actions can be set in blocks for the
following keywords:

* `case`
* `if`
* `else`
* `elsif`
* `group`

== Override Syntax

The format of an override is `<rcode> = (<integer>|<action>)` - That is,
a number greater than or equal to 0, or a named action.

.Named Actions
[options="header"]
[cols="30%,70%"]
|=====
| Action 	| Description
| break		| "break" out of the parent block and stop processing it.
| default	| Use the default priority for this rcode.
| reject	| return a `reject` rcode.
| retry		| re-run the section, as given by the the `retry` subsection.
| return	| return out of the parent block and stop processing it.
|=====

include::partial$rcode_table.adoc[]

== Retry subsection

The `retry` subsection is optional, and is only used when the
right-hand side of an action is `retry`.

.Retry Configuration
[options="header"]
[cols="30%,70%"]
|=====
| Configuration		| Description
| max_rtx_count		| maximum number of times this section is retried.
| max_rtx_time		| maximum time for one try before it is time out, and another retry made.
| max_rtx_duration	| maximum time for all retries before the section returns `fail`
|=====

All times and durations are parsed as the data type `time_delta`.

If no value is given, it is assumed to be zero.

.Syntax
[source,unlang]
----
string
integer
"double-quoted string"
'single-quoted string'
`back-quoted string`
----

Any text not matching xref:attr.adoc[&Attribute-Name] or
xref:condition/return_code.adoc[Return Code] is interpreted as a value for a
particular xref:type/index.adoc[data type].

Double-quoted strings and back-quoted strings are dynamically expanded
before the condition is evaluated.  Single-quoted strings are static
literals and are not dynamically expanded.

When used as an existence check, the condition evaluates to `true` if
the data is non-zero.  Otherwise, the condition evaluates to `false`.

For integer existence checks, `0` is `false`; all other values are `true`.

For string existence checks, an empty string is `false`.  All other
strings are `true`.

All other data types are disallowed in existence checks.

.Examples

`"hello there"` +
`5`

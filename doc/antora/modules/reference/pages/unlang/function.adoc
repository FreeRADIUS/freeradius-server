you can define functions inside of functions (why not?)

you can put functions into classes.  that defines the prefix, and the protocol.

otherwise the function must be generic, and not use any protocol-specific attributes.

class foo {
	proto = dhcpv4

}

function uint32 foo(uint32 bar, uint32 baz)
{


	return fff
}

and if the compiler finds a function which is referenced but doesn't exist, it looks in raddb/lib/func/foo/bar
with `.` replaced by `/`.

it should load the default class description in raddb/lib/class-name/DEFS

in xlat_tokenize(), when we get XLAT_FUNC_UNRESOLVED, add it to the unresolved function tree.

then

while (pop(tree)) {
	load function
	compile function
}

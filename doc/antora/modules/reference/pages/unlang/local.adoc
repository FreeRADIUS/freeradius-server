= Local Variables

Local variables can be defined and used inside of any `unlang`
processing section.  A local variable is used any time a "temporary"
variable is needed.  Local variables exist only within a particular
section (i.e. scope), and cannot be sent in a packet over the network.

.Syntax
[source,unlang]
----
<keyword> {
    <data-type> <name>
    ...

    [ statements ]
}
----

<keyword>:: An `unlang` keywords which does not create a subrequest.  i.e.  One of:

* xref:unlang/case.adoc[case]
* xref:unlang/else.adoc[else]
* xref:unlang/elsif.adoc[elsif]
* xref:unlang/foreach.adoc[foreach]
* xref:unlang/group.adoc[group]
* xref:unlang/if.adoc[if]
* xref:unlang/limit.adoc[limit]
* xref:unlang/load-balance.adoc[load-balance]
* xref:unlang/redundant.adoc[redundant]
* xref:unlang/redundant-load-balance.adoc[redundant-load-balance]
* xref:unlang/timeout.adoc[timeout]

Local variables are forbidden in all other locations.

For the xref:unlang/redundant.adoc[redundant] and xref:unlang/redundant-load-balance.adoc[redundant-load-balance] keyword, local variables are keep their value across the different subsections.  This behavior can be used to track state inside of the xref:unlang/redundant.adoc[redundant] section.

<data-type>:: A "leaf" xref:type/all_types.adoc[data type].  Structural types such as `group`, `struct`, `tlv`, etc. are not allowed.

<name>:: A unique name for the local variable.  This name cannot be the same as any previously-defined local variable in the same scope, and it cannot be the same as any attribute defined in the current protocol dictionary.

Multiple local variables may be defined.  All definitions must be at the top of a section.

[ statements ]:: The `unlang` commands which will be executed.  The local variable can be used, edited, modified, etc. within these statements.

Local variables cannot be deleted.  Multiple local variables of the same name cannot be used.  The local variables exist in their own list, and cannot be added to the normal lists `request`, `reply`, `control`, etc.

Local variables are _not_ automatically created.  There is no way to automatically determine what the "right" value is for a local variable.  Instead, they are declared at the top of a block, and are created only when they are first assigned a value.

Local variables _cannot_ be deleted.  When the current scope exits, the local variable is deleted and is no longer accessible.

.Example
[source,unlang]
----
if (&User-Name == "bob") {
    uint32 len

    &len := %length(%{User-Name})

    &Reply-Message := "Length of %{User-Name} is %{len}"
}
----

In v3 the default dictionaries included a series of `Tmp-*`
attributes.  These are no longer necessary, and should not be used.

.Local variables exist on only if they have been created
[source,unlang]
----
if (&User-Name == "bob") {
    # declare "len" as ALLOWED to be used
    uint32 len

    # this test ALWAYS fails, as "len" has not been assigned a value
    if (&len) {
       ...
    }

    #  "len" is created, and can now be used
    &len := %length(%{User-Name})

    &Reply-Message := "Length of %{User-Name} is %{len}"
}
----

The variable declaration and assignment must be sepaarted.  Constructions like `uint32 len = %length(%{User-Name})` are not allowed.

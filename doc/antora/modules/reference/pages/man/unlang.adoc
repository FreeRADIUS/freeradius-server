== NAME

unlang - Unlang Policy Language

== DESCRIPTION

The server supports a simple processing language called "Unlang",
which is short for "un-language". The original intention of using an
"un-language" was to avoid creating yet another programming language.
Instead, the `unlang` syntax allows for simple _if / then / else_
checks, and attribute editing.  It does not support recursion,
functions, infinite loops, or a host of other normal language
features.

## Arribute Operator Examples

'bob  Cleartext-Password := "hello"'

Requests containing the User-Name attribute, with value "bob", will be authenticated using the password "hello". There are no reply items, so the reply will be empty.

DEFAULT  Auth-Type = System
  Fall-Through = Yes

For all users reaching this entry, perform authentication against the system, unless Auth-Type has already been set. Also, process any following entries which may match.

If the request packet contains the attributes Service-Type and Framed-Protocol, with the given values, then include those attributes in the reply.
That is, give the user what they ask for. This entry also shows how to specify multiple reply items.
See the users file supplied with the server for more examples and comments.

DEFAULT  Service-Type == Framed-User, Framed-Protocol == PPP
  Service-Type = Framed-User,
  Framed-Protocol = PPP,
  Fall-Through = Yes

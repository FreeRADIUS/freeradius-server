= Man pages

These `man` pages are provided for quick reference, and for historical
compatibility.  In some cases, it is easier to type `man radiusd` than
to open a web browser, and navigate to the correct page.

That being said, the 'man' pages provide only brief summaries of
functionality.  The main documentation pages provide for significantly
more content and explanation.

The xref:man/radclient.adoc[radclient] program.

The main xref:man/radiusd.adoc[radiusd] server.

The command-line tool for radiusd, xref:man/radmin.adoc[radmin].

A RADIUS-aware packet capture tool, xref:man/radsniff.adoc[radsniff].

A simple summary of xref:man/unlang.adoc[unlang].

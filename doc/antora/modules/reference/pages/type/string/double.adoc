= Double Quoted Strings

.Syntax
`"string"`

A double-quoted string allows escape sequences and
xref:xlat/index.adoc[dynamic expansions]. As with
xref:type/string/single.adoc[single-quoted strings], text within
double quotes can include spaces.

The main difference between the single and double quoted strings is
that the double quoted strings can be dynamically expanded. The syntax
`${...}` is used for parse-time expansion and `%{...}` is used for
run-time expansion. The difference between the two methods is that the
`${...}` form is expanded when the server loads the configuration
files and is valid anywhere in the configuration files. The `%{...}`
xref:xlat/index.adoc[dynamic expansion] form is valid only in conditional
expressions and attribute assignments.

The output of the dynamic expansion can be interpreted as a string,
a number, or an IP address, depending on its context.

Note that the interpretation of text _strongly_ depends on the
context.  The text `"0000"` can be interpreted as a data type
"integer", having value zero, or a data type "string", having value
`"0000"`.  In general when a particular piece of text is used, it is
used with the context of a known attribute.  That attribute has a
xref:type/index.adoc[data type], and the text will be interpreted as that
data type.

NOTE: Most values retrieved from external datastores will be treated implicitly
as double-quoted strings.

== Escape sequences

Escape sequences allow the inclusion of characters that may be difficult to
represent in datastores, or the FreeRADIUS configuration files.

.Escape sequences and their descriptions
[options="header", cols="15%,85%"]
|=====
| Escape sequence     | Character represented
| `\\`                | Literal backslash (0x5c)
| `\r`                | Carriage return (0x0d)
| `\n`                | Line feed (0x0a)
| `\t`                | Horizontal tab (0x09)
| `\"`                | Double quote (0x22)
| `\x<hex><hex>`      | A byte whose numerical value is given by `<hex><hex>` interpreted as a hexadecimal number.
| `\<oct><oct><oct>`  | A byte whose numerical value is given by `<oct><oct><oct>` interpreted as an octal number.

== Methods of Creating Strings

There are a few different ways in which double-quoted strings can be
created.  The simplest is just an in-line string, as in `"string"`.
However, strings can also be created via
xref:unlang/expression.adoc[expressions]. and
xref:xlat/index.adoc[dynamic expansions].

In general, creating strings via xref:xlat/index.adoc[dynamic
expansions] will result in the _printed_ version of the expansion
being used.

.Example of double-quoted string expansion
[source,unlang]
----
"User-Name is %{User-Name}"
"IP Address is %{reply.Framed-IP-Address}
----

Both of the above expansions will return the _printed_ version of the
expansion.  For `User-Name`, it will be the string version of the
users name, as would be expected.  However, for the
`Framed-IP-Address` example, the printed version will be an ASCII
string such as `192.0.2.1`, even though the actual IP address is a
32-bit number.

When a string is created via an
xref:unlang/expression.adoc[expression] using the `+` operator, the
resulting string can be quite different, depending on the inputs.

.Example of casting to 'string'
[source,unlang]
----
"User-Name is " + &User-Name
"IP Address is " + (string) &reply.Framed-IP-Address
----

The output strings here (with casting) are the same as for the
previous example.  Note that we do not have to cast `&User-Name`,
because it is already a string.

.Example of casting to 'octets'
[source,unlang]
----
"User-Name is " + (octets) &User-Name
"IP Address is " + (octets) &reply.Framed-IP-Address
----

The output strings here are completely different than for the previous
examples.  The output data type is `octets`, and not `string`.

If the goal is to have the _raw_ `octets` data inserted into a
`string`, you must cast the octets to a string value.  That process
will copy the input `octets` value to a the output, changing the data
type to `string`.  The value is left alone.

.Example of casting to raw 'octets'
[source,unlang]
----
"User-Name is %{Tmp-Octets-0}"
"User-Name is %{(string) &Tmp-Octets-0}"
----

if the `&Tmp-Octets-0` attribute has value `0x666f6f` (`foo`)

In the first expansion, the resulting output is `User-Name is
0x666f6f`.  In the second expansion, the resulting output is
`User-name is foo`.

Note that placing raw `octets` data into a string may allow for binary
data to be inserted into what should be a printable string.  Any uses
of the string will result in the non-printable data being escaped as
`\000` or other methods such a `\n`, depending on how and wheere the
string is being used.

.Examples

`"word"` +
`"a string"' +
`"foo\"bar\""` +
`"this is a long string"` +
`"this has embedded\ncharacters"` +
`"attribute\tvalue\nusername\t%{User-Name}\nreply-message\t%{reply.Reply-Message}"`
`"The result of 'SELECT * FROM foo WHERE 1' is: %{sql:SELECT * FROM foo WHERE 1}"`

= Single Quoted Strings

.Syntax
`'string'`
`'''string with 'quote' embedded'''`

A single-quoted string is interpreted without any dynamic string
expansion. The quotes allow the string to contain spaces, among other
special characters.

The quotation character can be placed inside of the string by escaping
it with a backslash.

.Examples

`'hello'` +
`'foo bar`' +
`'foo\\'bar'` +
`'this is a long string'`

= Single Quoted Strings

.Syntax
`'string'`
`'''string with 'quote' embedded'''`

A single-quoted string is interpreted without any dynamic string
expansion. The quotes allow the string to contain spaces, among other
special characters.

For normally quoted strings, the quotation character can be placed inside of
the string by escaping it with a backslash.

For triple quoted strings, the quotation character does not need to be
escaped.  However, if the string does contain an escaped quotation
character, the quotation character is unescaped, as with normally
quoted strings.

.Examples

`'hello'` +
`'foo bar`' +
`'foo\\'bar'` +
`'this is a long string'`
`'''This is a string with 'embedded' quotes'''`

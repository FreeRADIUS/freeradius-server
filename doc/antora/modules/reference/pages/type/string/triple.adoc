= Triple Quoted Strings

.Syntax
`"""string"""`
`'''string'''`

Triple-quoted strings are similar to their single-quoted or
double-quoted counterparts.  The main difference is that for triple
quoted strings, the quotation character does not need to be escaped.
However, if the string does contain an escaped quotation character,
the quotation character is unescaped, as with normally quoted strings.

Triple-quoted strings make it easier to create strings with embedded
quotes in them, because the quotes do not need to be escaped.

.Examples

`"""word"""` +
`"a string"' +
`"""foo"bar"!"""` +
`"""this is a long string"""` +
`"""this has embedded\ncharacters"""` +
`"""this string has a "double quoted" string in the middle of it"""`
`'''This is a string with 'embedded' quotes'''`

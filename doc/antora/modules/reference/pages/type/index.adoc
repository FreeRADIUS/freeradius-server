= Data Types

Unlang supports a number of data types. These data types are used in
conditional expressions or when assigning a value to an attribute.

== Using Data Types

The server support a wide range of data types, as given in the
xref:unlang/type/all_types.adoc[list of data types] page.  The choice
of which data type applies is determined by the context in which that
data type is used.  This context is usually taken from an attribute
which is being assigned a value.

The `unlang` interpreter uses pre-defined attributes which are defined
in dictionaries.  The dictionaries define both a name, and a data type
for the attributes.  In the interpreter, then, attributes can be
assigned a value or compared to a value, without specifying the data
type.  The interpreter knows how to parse the value by using the data
type assigned to the attribute.

The result is that in most cases, it is not necessary to know the name
of the data types.  It is possible to write values in the format you
expect, and he server will do "the right thing" when interpreting the
values.

.Attributes with Different Data Types
[source,unlang]
----
Framed-IP-Address = 192.0.2.1
Framed-IPv6-Address = 2001:db8::
Reply-Message = "This is a reply"
Port-Limit = 5
Boolean = true
Octets-Thing = 0xabcdef0102030405
MAC-Address = 00:01:02:03:04:05
----

== Parsing Data Types

The interpreter is flexible when parsing data types.  So long as the
value can be parsed as the given data type without error, the value
will be accepted.

For example, a particular attribute may be of data type `ipaddr` in
order to store IPv4 addresses.  The interpreter will then accept the
following strings as valid IPv4 addresses:

`192.168.0.2`:: xref:type/string/unquoted.adoc[Unquoted text], interpreted as the data type

`'192.168.0.2'`:: xref:type/string/single.adoc[Single-quoted string], the contents of the string are parsed as the data type.
+
The single-quoted string form is most useful when the data type
contains special characters that may otherwise confuse the parser.

`"192.168.0.2"`:: xref:type/string/double.adoc[Double-quoted string].
+
The contents of the string are dynamically expanded as described in
the xref:unlang/xlat/index.adoc[dynamic expansion] page.  The
resulting output is then interpreted as the given data type.

`{backtick}/bin/echo 192.168.0.2{backtick}`:: xref:type/string/backticks.adoc[backtick-quoted string].
Run a script, and parse the resulting string as the data type.

Similar processing rules are applied when parsing assignments and
comparisons, for all attributes and data types.

=== Casting Data Types

In some cases, it is necessary to parse values which do not refer to
attributes.  This situation usually occurs when two values need to be
compared, as in the following example:

[source,unlang]
----
if ("%{sql:SELECT ipaddress FROM table WHERE user=%{User-Name}}" == 192.0.2.1) }
    ....
}
----

Since there is no attribute on either side of the `==` operator, the
interpreter has no way of knowing that the string `192.0.2.1` is an IP
address.  There is unfortunately no way of automatically parsing
strings in order to determine the data type to use.  Any such
automatic parsing would work most of the time, but it would have
error cases where the parsing was incorrect.

The solution is to resolve these ambiguities by allowing the values to
be cast to a particular type.  Casting a value to a type tells the
interpreter how that value should be parsed.  Casting is done by
prefixing a value with the type name, surrounded by angle brackets;
`<...>`.

.Syntax
----
<...>value
----

We can add a cast to the above example, as follows:

[source,unlang]
----
if ("%{sql:SELECT ipaddress FROM table WHERE user=%{User-Name}}" == <ipaddr>192.0.2.1) }
    ....
}
----

In this example, we prefix the IP address with the string `<ipaddr>`.
The interpreter then knows that the value `192.0.2.` should be
interpreted as the data type `ipaddr`, and not as the literal string
`"192.0.2."`.

For a full list of data types which can be used in a cast, please see
the xref:unlang/type/all_types.adoc[list of data types] page, and the
"Basic Type Types" section.

= Encoders and Decoders

These functions perform encoding and decoding of data for the
networking protocols.  These expansions can be used to manually encode
and decode raw data.

In general, however, we recommend updating the dictionaries to
automatically handle the information.  The dictionaries support
structures, bit fields, and many many more features than previous
versions of FreeRADIUS.  There are few situations where manual
encoding and decoding is necessary.

That being said, the main use of these expansions is for the
"internal" protocol.  This is a virtual protocol which can encode and
decode any attribute from any protocol.

If you need to store attributes in an external database, then it is
possible to encode them via `%internal.encode(...)`.  The result will
be an opaque hex string which can be treated as an opaque blob, and
stored externally.  Then, when the data is needed again, it can be
turned back into attributes via `%internal.decode(...)`.

== %PROTO.decode(_octets_)

Decodes the input octers as the named protocol.  The input can also be
an attribute reference, which is usually a reference to an attribute
of type `octets.

Each `PROTO.decode` function is automatically registered for every
protocol which is used by the server.

Note that the output attributes _must_ come from the same dictionary
as the `request` they are being added to.  For example, you cannot use
`dhcpv4.decode` inside of a virtual server which has `namespace =
radius`.  Doing so would result in DHCPv4 attributes being inside of a
RADIUS virtual server, which is not allowed.

.Return: _integer_

It returns the number of attributes which were decoded.

.Example

[source,unlang]
----
%dhcpv4.decode(0x520d0103abcdef0206010203040506)
%radius.decode(0x010641424344)
----

.Output

```
Relay-Agent-Information.Circuit-Id = 0xabcdef, &Relay-Agent-Information.Remote-Id = 0x010203040506
User-Name = "ABCD"
```

== %PROTO.encode(_list_)

Encodes _list_ as the named protocol.  The _list_ can also be a series of attributes.

The `PROTO.encode` expansion is automatically registered for every
protocol which is used by the server.

.Return: _octets_

It returns the raw encoded data

.Example

[source,unlang]
----
%dhcpv4.encode("&Relay-Agent-Information.Circuit-Id = 0xabcdef, &Relay-Agent-Information.Remote-Id = 0x010203040506")
%radius.encode("&User-Name = 'ABCD'")
Tmp-Octets-1 := %dhcpv4.encode(&request.Relay-Agent-Information.[*])
----

.Output

```
0x520d0103abcdef0206010203040506
0x010641424344
```

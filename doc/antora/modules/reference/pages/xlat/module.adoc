= Module References

Individual modules may be referenced via the following syntax:

`%{module:string}`

These references are allowed only by a small number of modules that
usually perform database lookups. The module name is the actual name of
the module, as described earlier. The string portion is specific to each
module and is not documented here. It is, however, usually dynamically
expanded to allow for additional flexibility.

.Examples

`%{sql:SELECT name FROM mytable WHERE username = %{User-Name}}`

= Built-In Expansions

In addition to storing attribute references, the server has a number
of built-in expansions.  These expansions act largely as functions
which operate on inputs, and produce an output.

== Attribute Manipulation

=== %(length: ... )

The `length` expansion returns the size of the input as an integer.
When the input is a string, then the output is identical to the
`strlen` expansion.

When the input is an attribute reference, the output is the size of
the attributes data as encoded "on the wire".

.Return: _size_

.Determining the length of fixed and variable length attributes
====
[source,unlang]
----
&Tmp-String-0 := "Caipirinha"
&Framed-IP-Address := 192.0.2.1

&reply += {
	&Reply-Message = "The length of %{control.Tmp-String-0} is %(length:&control.Tmp-String-0)"
	&Reply-Message = "The length of %{control.Framed-IP-Address} is %(length:&control.Framed-IP-Address)"
}
----

.Output
....
The length of Caipirinha is 10
The length of 192.168.0.2 is 4
....
====

=== %(integer:<value>)

Convert a value to an integer.

In normal operation, `integer` attributes are printed using the name
given by a `VALUE` statement in a dictionary. Similarly, date
attributes are printed as dates, i.e., "January 1 2010.

The `integer` expansion applies only to attributes which can be
converted to an integer. For all other inputs, it returns `0`.

A common usage is to find the difference between two dates.

For example, if a request contains `Service-Type = Login-User`, the
expansion of `%(integer:%{Service-Type})` will yield `1`, which is the
value associated with the `Login-User` name. Using
`%(integer:%{Event-Timestamp})` will return the event timestamp as an
unsigned 32-bit number.

.Return: _string_

.Determining the integer value of an enumerated attribute
====
[source,unlang]
----
&control.Service-Type := Login-User
&reply.Reply-Message := "The value of Service-Type is %(integer:%{control.Service-Type})"
----

.Output

```
The value of Service-Type is 1
```
====

=== %{rand:<number>}

Generate random number from `0` to `<number>-1`.

.Return: _uint64_

.Generating a random number between 0 and 511
====
[source,unlang]
----
&reply.Reply-Message := "The random number is %{rand:512}"
----

.Output

```
The random number is 347
```
====

=== %{string:<data>}

Convert input to a string if (possible).  For _octets_ type
attributes, this means interpreting the data as a UTF8 string.  Any
non-printable characters are left in place.

For other types, this means printing the value in its _presentation_ format,
i.e. dotted quads for IPv4 addresses, link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601[ISO 8601]
time for date types, enumeration values for attributes such as `radius.Service-Type` etc.

In practice, the only real use of this expansion is to insert `octets`
data types into a `string`.  For other data types, using
`%{string:...}` is not necessary.  For example, for any data type
other than `octets`, the following equivalency holds true.

See xref:type/string/double.adoc[double-quoted strings] and
xref:type/cast.adoc[casting] for examples of how strings are used.

.String expansion equivalents
====
[source,unlang]
----
"foo" + (string)&Bar == "foo%{Bar}"
----
====

.Output

```
The string value of 0x7465737431 is test1
```

== Encoders and Decoders

The server supports manual encoding and decoding of a variety of
protocols.  These expansions can be used to manually encode and decode
raw data.

In general, however, we recommend updating the dictionaries to
automatically handle the relevant data.  The dictionaries support
structures, bit fields, and many many more features than previous
versions of FreeRADIUS.  There are few situations where manual
encoding and decoding is necessary.

That being said, the main use of these expansions is for the
"internal" protocol.  This is a virtual protocol which can encode and
decode any attribute from any protocol.

If you need to store attributes in an external database, then it is
possible to encode them via `%(internal.encode:...)`.  The result will
be an opaque hex string which can be treated as an opaque blob, and
stored externally.  Then, when the data is needed again, it can be
turned back into attributes via `%(internal.decode:...)`.

=== %(PROTO.decode:<data>)

Decodes _data_ as the named protocol.  The _data_ string can be an
expansion, which is usually a reference to an attribute of type `octets.

The `PROTO.decode` expansion is automatically registered for every
protocol which is used by the server.

Note that the output attributes _must_ come from the same dictionary
as the `request` they are being added to.  For example, you cannot use
`dhcpv4.decode` inside of a virtual server which has `namespace =
radius`.  Doing so would result in DHCPv4 attributes being inside of a
RADIUS virtual server, which is not allowed.

.Return: _integer_

It returns the number of attributes which were decoded.

.Example

[source,unlang]
----
%(dhcpv4.decode:0x520d0103abcdef0206010203040506)
%(radius.decode:0x010641424344)
----

.Output

```
&Relay-Agent-Information.Circuit-Id = 0xabcdef, &Relay-Agent-Information.Remote-Id = 0x010203040506
&User-Name = "ABCD"
```

=== %(PROTO.encode:<list>)

Encodes _list_ as the named protocol.  The _list_ can also be a series of attributes.

The `PROTO.encode` expansion is automatically registered for every
protocol which is used by the server.

.Return: _octets_

It returns the raw encoded data

.Example

[source,unlang]
----
%(dhcpv4.encode:&Relay-Agent-Information.Circuit-Id = 0xabcdef  &Relay-Agent-Information.Remote-Id = 0x010203040506)
%(radius.encode:&User-Name = "ABCD")
----

.Output

```
0x520d0103abcdef0206010203040506
0x010641424344
```

== Interpreter State

The state of the interpreter can be queried via the
`%(interpeter:<name>)` expansion.  The individual expansions are
documented below.

Each expansion given here can be prefixed with one or more dot (`.`)
characters.  These dots allow the expansion to refer to the current
request via a `name`, or the parent request via `.name`.  If there is
no parent, the expansion returns the string `<underflow>`.

=== %(interpeter:module)

The current module being executed.  If the expansions is done in an
`unlang` statement and outside of any module, it returns the name of
the previous module which was executed.

=== %(interpeter:processing_stage)

Which section of a virtual server is processing the request.

=== %(interpeter:rcode)

The current interpreter return code, e.g. `handle`, or `ok`, etc.

=== %(interpeter:server)

The name of the virtual server which is running the request.

== Server Configuration

=== %(config:<key>)

== Miscellaneous Expansions

=== +%{0}+..+%{32}+

`%{0}` expands to the portion of the subject that matched the last regular
expression evaluated. `%{1}`..`%{32}` expand to the contents of any capture
groups in the pattern.

Every time a regular expression is evaluated, whether it matches or not,
the numbered capture group values will be cleared.

=== +%{regex:<named capture group>}+

Return named subcapture value from the last regular expression evaluated.

Results of named capture groups are available using the `%{regex:<named capture
group>}` expansion. They will also be accessible using the numbered expansions
described xref:xlat/builtin.adoc#_0_32[above].

Every time a regular expression is evaluated, whether it matches or not,
the named capture group values will be cleared.

[NOTE]
====
This expansion is only available if the server is built with libpcre or libpcre2.
Use the output of `radiusd -Xxv` to determine which regular expression library in use.

....
...
Debug :   regex-pcre               : no
Debug :   regex-pcre2              : yes
Debug :   regex-posix              : no
Debug :   regex-posix-extended     : no
Debug :   regex-binsafe            : yes
...
Debug :   pcre2                    : 10.33 (2019-04-16) - retrieved at build time
....
====

=== +%(eval:<string>)+

Evaluates the string as an expansion, and returns the result.  The main difference between using this expansion and just using `%{...}` is that the string being evaluated can be dynamically changed.

.Return: _data_

.Example

[source,unlang]
----
if (&User-Name == "bob") {
    &request.Tmp-String-0 := "&User-Name"
} else {
    &request.Tmp-String-0 := "not bob!"
}

&reply.Reply-Message := "%{eval:&request.Tmp-String-0}"
----

.Output when `&User-Name == bob`

```
bob
```

.Output when `&User-Name == not bob`

```
not bob!
```


=== +%(expr:<string>)+

Evaluates the string as an xref:reference:unlang/expression.adoc[Unlang expression], and returns the result.  Please see the
xref:reference:unlang/expression.adoc[Unlang expression] page for full documentation on expressions.

[NOTE]
====
You probably don't want to use this.  In v4, the main use of `%{expr:...}` is inside of strings which can't be split into actual expressions.
====

.Return: _data_

.Example

[source,unlang]
----
&reply.Tmp-String-0 := "%{expr:1 + 2}"
----

.Output

```
3
```

.A Better example of not using `%{expr:...}`

[source,unlang]
----
&Tmp-String-0 := 1 + 2
----



=== +%(nexttime:<time>)+

Calculate number of seconds until next n hour(`s`), day(`s`), week(`s`), year(`s`).

.Return: _string_

.Example

With the current time at 16:18, `%(nexttime:1h)` will expand to `2520`.

[source,unlang]
----
&reply.Reply-Message := "You should wait for %(nexttime:1h)s"
----

.Output

```
You should wait for 2520s
```

=== +%{pack:%{Attribute-Name}%{Attribute-Name}...}+

Pack multiple multiple attributes and/or literals into a binary string.
For best results, each attribute passed to `pack` should be fixed size.
That is, not data type `octets` or `string` as the length of those values
will not be encoded.

See also the `unpack` module, which is the inverse to `pack`.

.Return: _octets_

.Example

[source,unlang]
----
&reply.Class := "%{pack:%{reply.Framed-IP-Address}%{NAS-IP-Address}}"
----

.Output

```
You should wait for 2520s
```

=== +%{Packet-Type}+

The packet type (`Access-Request`, etc.)

=== +%{Packet-SRC-IP-Address} and %{Packet-SRC-IPv6-Address}+

The source IPv4 or IPv6 address of the packet. See also the expansions
`%(client:ipaddr)` and `%(client:ipv6addr)`. The two expansions
should be identical, unless `%(client:ipaddr)` contains a DNS hostname.

=== +%{Packet-DST-IP-Address} and %{Packet-DST-IPv6-Address}+

The destination IPv4 or IPv6 address of the packet. See also the
expansions `%{listen:ipaddr}` and `%{listen:ipv6addr}`. If the socket
is listening on a "wildcard" address, then these two expansions will be
different, as follows: the `%{listen:ipaddr}` will be the wildcard
address and `%{Packet-DST-IP-Address}` will be the unicast address to
which the packet was sent.

=== +%{Packet-SRC-Port} and %{Packet-DST-Port}+

The source/destination ports associated with the packet.

.Return: _string_.

.Example

[source,unlang]
----
&control.Tmp-String-0 := "user@example.com"

if (&control.Tmp-String-0 =~ /^(?<login>(.*))@(?<domain>(.*))$/) {
    &reply.Reply-Message := "The %{control.Tmp-String-0} { login=%{regex:login}, domain=%{regex:domain} }"
}
----

.Output

```
The user@example.com { login=user, domain=example.com }
```

### %(sub:<subject> /<regex>/[flags] <replace>)

Substitute text just as easily as it can match it, even using regex patterns.

.Return: _string_.

.Example

[source,unlang]
----
&control.Tmp-String-0 := "Caipirinha is a light and refreshing drink!"
&reply.Reply-Message := "%(sub:%{control.Tmp-String-0} / / ,)"
----

.Output

```
Caipirinha,is,a,light,and,refreshing,drink!
```

### %(time:)

Return the current time.

.Return: _date_.

If no argument is passed, it returns the current time.  Otherwise if the argument is:

* `dst` - returns a `bool` indicating whether or not the system is running in daylight savings time.
* `mday_offset` - returns the `time_delta` offset since the start of the month.  Use `%d` to get an integer representing the day of the month.
* `now` - returns the current time
* `offset` - returns a `time_delta` of the current time zone offset.  This value may be negative.
* `request` - returns the time at which the request packet was received (always less than `now`!)
* `wday_offset` - returns the `time_delta` offset since the start of the week.
* any other string is parsed as type `date`, using the normal date parsing routines.

.Example

[source,unlang]
----
&Acct-Start-Time := %(time:now)
----

[NOTE]
====
This expansion should be used in preference to the xref:xlat/character.adoc[single letter expansions] `%l`.  That expansion returns integer seconds, and is not suitable for millisecond or microsecond resolution.
====

Due to limitations in the underlying time funtions (both system and
FreeRADIUS), previous versions of FreeRADIUS did not always handle
dates correctly.  When print dates, the time zone information would
sometimes not be printed, or the time zone would sometimes be ignored
when parsed a date from a string.

Even if the time zone was used, the nature of time zones means that
there may be duplicate time zone names!  For example, the time zone
`CST` has three separate (and different) definitions.

The server now tracks all times internally as UTC, and by default
prints times as UTC, or prints the time zone as a decimal offset from
UTC, instead of printing an ambiguous name.

This handling of time zones has some minor side effects.  When
calculating values like "tomorrow", the default is to return the UTC
version of "tomorrow".  This value may not be what you want.

In order to correctly calculate the local value of "tomorrow", it is
necessary to add the local time zone offset to the UTC time.

Note that the server will automatically determine (and use) any
daylight savings time differences.  So the value of `%(time:offset)`
may change while the server is running!

The following example calculates the correct value of "tomorrow" in
UTC by using the following steps:

* taking the current time of the request
* calculating how long it has been since the start of the day as a `time_delta`
* subtracting that `time_delta` from the current time

.Example Calculating the UTC value of "tomorrow"
[source,unlang]
----
group {
    date now
    date tomorrow
    time_delta time_of_day

    &now := %(time:request)

    #  We are this many seconds into one day
    &time_of_day := &now % (time_delta) 1d

    # calculate the start of today, and then add one day to that
    &tomorrow := &now - &time_of_day + (time_delta) 1d
}
----

The following example calculates the correct value of "tomorrow" in
local time by using the preceding example, but then adding the local
time zone offset to the final value.

.Example Calculating the local value of "tomorrow"
[source,unlang]
----
group {
    date now
    date tomorrow
    time_delta time_of_day

    &now := %(time:request)

    #  We are this many seconds into one day
    &time_of_day := &now % (time_delta) 1d

    # calculate the start of today, and then add one day to that
    &tomorrow := &now - &time_of_day + (time_delta) 1d

    #  add in the time zone offset
    &tomorrow += %(time:offset)
}
----

This kind of math works well for "tomorrow", but it is less useful for
"next week Monday", or "start of next month".  The `%{nexttime:..}`
expansion above should be used for those time operations.

= Deprecated or removed Expansions.

There are a number of expansions in v3 which have been either
deprecated or removed in v4.  The following text explains why these
functions were removed, and what functionality has replaced them.

== %expr(...)

This expansion has been removed.  Instead, just use `%{ ... }`.

[source,unlang]
----
reply.Reply-Message := "The 1 + 2 = %{1 + 2}"
----

== %integer(...)

This expansion has been removed.  Instead, just use `%{(integer) ...}` with math inside of the brackets.

[source,unlang]
----
reply.Reply-Message := "Value of Service-Type is %{(integer) Service-Type}"
----

=== +%pack(%{Attribute-Name}%{Attribute-Name}...)+

Pack multiple multiple attributes and/or literals into a binary string.
For best results, each attribute passed to `pack` should be fixed size.
That is, not data type `octets` or `string` as the length of those values
will not be encoded.

See also the `unpack` module, which is the inverse to `pack`.

.Return: _octets_

.Example

[source,unlang]
----
reply.Class := "%pack(%{reply.Framed-IP-Address}%{NAS-IP-Address}}"
----

It is easier to just use casting and string append:

.Better example

[source,unlang]
----
reply.Class := (octets) Framed-IP-Address + (octets) NAS-IP-Address.
----

== %string(...)

This expansion has been removed.  Instead, just use `%{(string) ...}` with an expression inside of the brackets.

[source,unlang]
----
reply.Reply-Message := "The printable version of Class is %{(string) Class}"
----

== %strlen( ... )

This expansion is deprecated and will be removed.  Just use `%length(...)` instead.

== %regex.search(pattern, string)

Performs a regular expression search on _string_, using _pattern_.  If
there are subgroups in _pattern_, the subgroups are available via a
subsequent `%regex.match()`.  Each regular expression search (or
xref:unlang/condition/regex.adoc[=~] operator) clears and list of
matches in `%regex.match()`.

This function is the same as using `%{string =~ /pattern/}`.  However,
this function is included for completeness.

== %regex.match(0)+..+%regex.match(32)

`%regex.match(0)` expands to the portion of the subject that matched the last regular
expression evaluated. `%regex.match(1)`..`%regex.match(32)` expand to the contents of any capture
groups in the pattern.

Every time a regular expression is evaluated, whether it matches or not,
the numbered capture group values will be cleared.

== +%regex.match(<named capture group>}+

Return named subcapture value from the last regular expression evaluated.

Results of named capture groups are available using the `%regex.match(<named capture
group>}` expansion. They will also be accessible using the numbered expansions
described xref:xlat/misc/misc.adoc#_0_32[above].

Every time a regular expression is evaluated, whether it matches or not,
the named capture group values will be cleared.

[NOTE]
====
This expansion is only available if the server is built with libpcre2.
Use the output of `radiusd -Xxv` to determine which regular expression library in use.

== +%eval(<string>)+

Evaluates the string as an expansion, and returns the result.  The main difference between using this expansion and just using `%{...}` is that the string being evaluated can be dynamically changed.

.Return: _data_

.Example

[source,unlang]
----
if (User-Name == "bob") {
    request.Tmp-String-0 := "User-Name"
} else {
    request.Tmp-String-0 := "not bob!"
}

reply.Reply-Message := "%eval(request.Tmp-String-0}"
----

.Output when `User-Name == bob`

```
bob
```

.Output when `User-Name == not bob`

```
not bob!
```

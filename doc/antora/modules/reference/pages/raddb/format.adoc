= Configuration File Format

The server configuration files all share a standard format.  A common
format ensures that it is simple to read, edit, and understand the
configuration.

When the server starts, it loads all of the configurations files.
These files are usually kept separate on disk for organization and
management purpose.  However, the files are all part of the global
"server configuration".  That is, the organization of the _file names_
is completely independent of the _file contents_.

The configuration files also include the
xref:reference:unlang/index.adoc[unlang] policies.  While those policies have a
similar format as described here, the formats ar not exactly the same.

== Comments and Blank Lines

The configuration files may contain comments and blank lines.
Comments are text which has meaning to the administrator, but which is
not used to configure the server.

Comments begin with the `#` character, and can be placed anywhere on a
line.  All text after the `#` character is ignored by the server.

.Syntax
----
 # this is a comment
----

The server ignores all blank lines and comments.

== Named Variables

The configuration files can set _named variables_ which are given a
_value_.  These variables are also referred to as _configuration items_.

.Syntax
----
name = value
----

name:: The _name_ of the configuration variable.
+
The _name_ is usually a descriptive English word.  It can be
composed of letters (upper and lower case), numbers, and underscores.
+
The allowed names change depending on the context of the variable.

operator:: The `=` character is the only permitted operator for
configuration variables.

value:: The _value_ of the configuration variable.
+
The _value_ of a variable is a value which is assigned to _name_.
Types of values are unquoted text, single-quoted strings, and
double-quoted strings.  Back-tick strings are not permitted.

The interpretation of the _value_ depends on the meaning of _name_.
The parser is generally forgiving, and will accept anything that can
be interpreted as being in the correct format.  For example, when a
configuration variable is documented as taking an IP address, all of
the following examples result in the same configuration:

.Equivalent Configurations
====
----
ipaddr = 192.0.2.2
ipaddr = '192.0.2.2'
ipaddr = "  192.0.2.2"
----
====

=== Unquoted Strings

Unquoted strings delimited by spaces, or by other tokens.  This
unquoted text is interpreted as a simple string and are generally
equivalent to placing the string in single quotes.

.Unquoted Strings
====
----
ipaddr = 192.168.0.2
delay = 1
locking = yes
filename = /path/
----
====

=== Single-Quoted Strings

A single-quoted string allow it to contain spaces, among other
special characters. The single quote character can be placed in such a
string by escaping it with a backslash.

.Single-Quoted Strings
====
----
message = 'Hello there'
filter = 'yes \` is allowed`
----
====

=== Double-Quoted Strings

A double-quoted string allows escape sequences and variable
references. As with single-quoted strings, text within double quotes
can include spaces.

The main difference between double quoted strings and other types is
that the double quoted strings can expand variable references. Please
see the <<Variable References>> section for more information.

The contents of a double-quoted can be interpreted as a string, a
number, or an IP address, depending on the configuration variable.

.Double-Quoted Strings
====
----
message = "Hello there"
filter = "yes \" is allowed"
----
====

=== Escape sequences

Escape sequences in double-quoted strings allow characters which may
be otherwise difficult to represent.

.Escape sequences and their descriptions
[options="header", cols="15%,85%"]
|=====
| Escape sequence     | Character represented
| `\\`                | Literal backslash (0x5c)
| `\r`                | Carriage return (0x0d)
| `\n`                | Line feed (0x0a)
| `\t`                | Horizontal tab (0x09)
| `\"`                | Double quote (0x22)
| `\x<hex><hex>`      | A byte whose numerical value is given by `<hex><hex>` interpreted as a hexadecimal number.
| `\x<oct><oct><oct>` | A byte whose numerical value is given by `<oct><oct><oct>` interpreted as an octal number.
|=====

== Configuration Sections

A _configuration section_ is allows named variables to be collected
together in a logical group.  Configuration sections can also contain
other configuration sections, to any depth of nesting.

A configuration section begins with a section name, followed on the
same line by an open bracket `{`.  A section ends with a close bracket
`}`.

.Syntax
----
<name> [<instance>] {
    [ statements ]
}
----

<name>:: The name of this configuration section.  The set of allowed
names depends on the context.

<instance>:: An optional section name.

[ statements ]:: Zero or more statements, including comments, variable
assignments, and other sections.


.Configuration Section
====
----
group {
    foo = bar
    baz = hello
    subgroup {
        bug = gone
    }
}
----
====

In some circumstances, configuration section can have a second name
following the first one. The situations where this is permitted depend
on the context.  Please see the configuration file contents for
information on when and where these second names are allowed.

We also use the word _instance_ or _instance names_ when referring to
the second name of a section.

.Configuration Section
====
----
group mine {
    yours = bob
    theirs = no
}
----
====

== Additional Functionality

The configuration file format has additional functionality which is
described here.

=== Long Lines

Long lines can be broken up via continuations, using `\\` as the last
character of the line.  When one line is continued to another, the
result is treated as if all of the "continued" text was on one line.

.Text Broken across multiple lines
====
----
foo = "blah \
blah \
blah"
----
====

This example will set the value of the variable `foo` to `blah blah
blah`.  Any CR or LF is not turned into a space, but all other
whitespace is preserved in the final value.

=== Including other files

As noted above, the configuration is logically one global "server
configuration", but is split up into multiple files on disk.  This
splitting is done by the use of a `$INCLUDE` statement.

.Syntax
----
$INCLUDE <filename>
-$INCLUDE <filename>
----

$INCLUDE:: Key word to load the *<filename>*, and to fail if the file does
not exist, or cannot be parsed

-$INCLUDE:: Key word to load the *<filename>*, and to silently do
nothing if the file does not exist.  If the file does exist, this
keyword behaves exactly the same as `$INCLUDE`.

<filename>:: The filename to include
+
If *<filename>* begins with a `/` character, then it is
assumed to be a full path to the file, starting at the "root"
directory of the file system.
+
If *<filename>* does not begin with a `/` character, then it is
assumed to be a path relative to the current file being read.


.Including other files
====
----
foo = bar
$INCLUDE other.conf
----
====

=== Configuration as a Database

The configuration file parser is independent of the server
configuration. This means that you can put almost anything into the
configuration file. So long as it is properly formatted, the server
will start.

When the server parses the configuration file, it looks only for those
configurations it understands. Extra configuration items are ignored.
This "feature" can be (ab)used in certain interesting ways.

For example, you can "annotate" a configuration section with
additional variables which will be accepted, but ignored.  These
variables can be used as a simple read-only key-value store.

=== Variable References

When the _value_ of a configuration variable is a double-quoted
string, the parser looks in the input string for variable references.
If a reference is found to another variable, then the reference is
replaced with the value of that variable. The _value_ can also be just
an unquoted variable reference.

These references are evaluated when the configuration file is loaded,
which means that there is no run-time cost associated with them. This
feature is most useful for turning long, repeated pieces of text into
short ones.

Variables are referenced by `${variable_name}`, as in the following
examples.

.Simple Variable References
====
----
foo = bar       # set variable 'foo' to value 'bar'
who = ${foo}    # sets variable 'who' to value of variable 'foo'
my = "${foo} a" # sets variable 'my' to "bar a"
----
====

If the variable exists in a section or subsection, it can be
referenced as `${section.subsection.variable}`.  Forward references
are not allowed.

Relative references are allowed, by prepending the name with one or
more periods.

.References in the Current Section
====
----
foo = bar
blogs = ${.foo}  # set 'blogs' to 'bar'
ergo = "${foo}"  # set 'ergo' to 'bar'
----
====

.Parent References
====
----
group {
    foo = bar
    subgroup {
        blogs = ${..foo}
    }
}
----
====

Will set variable `blogs` to the value `bar`.  That value is taken
from the variable `foo`, which is contained in the a parent section
of the section containing `blogs`

.References to Other Sections
====
----
blogs = ${modules.detail.filename}
----
====

Will set variable `blogs` to the value of variable `filename`, of the
`detail` module, which is in the `modules` section of the
configuration file.

Properties of anonymous parent sections may also be referenced, by
using a `:` after the section reference.  Currently `:name` and `:instance`
are supported.

.References to the Name of a Section
====
----
modules {
    example foo {
        file = ${.:name}
    }
}
----
====

Will set variable `file` to the name of the containing section, in
this case, `example`.

.References to the Instance of a Section
====
----
modules {
    example foo {
        file = ${.:instance}
    }
}
----
====

Will set variable `file` to the instance name of the containing
section, in this case `foo`.

.Combining References
====
----
modules {
    example foo {
        file = ${..:name}
    }
}
----
====

Will set variable `file` to the name of the parent of the containing
section, in this case `modules`.

A string can contain multiple references, which will all be
expanded.

.Multiple References
====
----
foo = bar
baz = bug
blogs = "this ${foo} is ${baz}"
----
====

Will set variable `blogs` to the string `this bar is bug`.

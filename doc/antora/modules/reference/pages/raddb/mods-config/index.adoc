= The mods-config Directory

This directory contains module-specific configuration files. These files
are in a format different from the one used by the main `radiusd.conf`
files. Earlier versions of the server had many module-specific files in
the main `raddb` directory. The directory contained many files, and it
was not clear which files did what.

For Version 3 of FreeRADIUS, we have moved to a consistent naming
scheme. Each module-specific configuration file is placed in this
directory, in a subdirectory named for the module. Where necessary,
files in the subdirectory have been named for the processing section
where they are used.

For example, the `users` file is now located in
`mods-config/files/authorize`. That filename tells us three things:

* The file is used in the `authorize` section.
* The file is used by the `files` module.
* It is a `module configuration` file, which is a specific format.

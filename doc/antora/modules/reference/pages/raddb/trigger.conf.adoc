= Triggers

Triggers are events in the server can cause a hook to be executed.

The triggers are named as `type.subtype.value`.  These names refer
to subsections and then configuration items in the `trigger`
section below.  When an event occurs, the trigger is executed.  The
trigger is simply a program that is run, with optional arguments.

The server does not wait when a trigger is executed.  It is simply
a `one-shot` event that is sent.

NOTE: The trigger names should be self-explanatory.



## SNMP configuration

For now, this is only for SNMP traps.

They are enabled by uncommenting (or adding) `$INCLUDE trigger.conf`
in the main `radiusd.conf` file.

The traps *require* that the files in the "mibs" directory be copied
to the global mibs directory, usually `/usr/share/snmp/mibs/`.
If this is not done, the `snmptrap` program has no idea what information
to send, and will not work.  The MIB installation is *not* done as
part of the default installation, so that step *must* be done manually.

The global MIB directory can be found by running the following command:

    snmptranslate -Dinit_mib .1.3 2>&1 | grep MIBDIR | \
        sed "s/' .*//;s/.* '//;s/.*://"

Or maybe just:

    snmptranslate -Dinit_mib .1.3 2>&1 | grep MIBDIR

If you have copied the MIBs to that directory, you can test the
FreeRADIUS MIBs by running the following command:

    snmptranslate -m +FREERADIUS-NOTIFICATION-MIB -IR -On serverStart

It should print out:

    .1.3.6.1.4.1.11344.4.1.1

As always, run the server in debugging mode after enabling the
traps.  You will see the `snmptrap` command being run, and it will
print out any errors or issues that it encounters.  Those need to
be fixed before running the server in daemon mode.

We also suggest running in debugging mode as the `radiusd` user, if
you have "user" or "group" set in `radiusd.conf`.  The `snmptrap`
program may behave differently when run as `root` rather than the
`radiusd` user.


Configuration for SNMP traps / notifications, used in the
"snmptrap" option below.

To disable traps, edit `radiusd.conf` and delete the line
which says `$INCLUDE trigger.conf`.


cmd:: Absolute path for the `snmptrap` command, and
default command-line arguments.

You can also temporarily disable traps by changing
the command to `/bin/echo`.



community:: The SNMP community string



agent:: Agent configuration



snmptrap:: Define the full command used to run the traps.

This entry should not be edited.  Instead, edit the "trap" section above.



## Trigger definitions

The individual triggers are defined here.  You can disable one by
deleting it, or by commenting it out.  You can disable an entire
section of traps by deleting the section.

The entries below should not be edited.  For example, the double colons
  *must* immediately follow the `${snmptrap}` reference.  Adding a space
before the double colons  will break all SNMP traps.

The triggers just programs which are run when particular events
occur.  If you want to replace an SNMP trap with another program,
you can.  Just edit the definitions below, so that they run a
program of your choice.

For example, you can leverage the "start/stop" triggers to run a
program when the server starts, or when it stops.  However, only
one program will be executed per trigger.


### Server core triggers

The 'server' section is for events that happen in the
server core


start:: The server has just started.



stop:: The server is about to stop.



max_requests:: The "max_requests" condition has been reached.

This will trigger only once per 60 seconds.



### Module triggers

Triggers for specific modules.  These are *not* in the
module configuration because they are global to all
instances of the module.  You can have module-specific
triggers, by placing a `trigger` subsection in the module
configuration.  Not all modules support a `trigger`
subsection.




### Trunk connection triggers

The following modules use trunk connections:

  - ldap
  - sql
  - radius
  - tacacs

and these all support the following triggers relating to trunk
connection state changes.

Instead of globally configuring these triggers here, they should be configured per module instance
by including a `trigger` section within the module instance `pool` section.  That allows for
the `${.:name}` and `${.:instance}` expansions to reference the correct module name and instance name.

In addition to either enabling the triggers here or within the module `pool` section, for triggers
to be enabled for a specific module instance, the `triggers` option within the `pool` section needs
to be set to `yes`.


Define common arguments to use below:



connection_halted:: A connection has entered the "halted" state.

All connections start in this state, and return to it after closing.



connection_init:: A connection is being initialised



connection_connecting::  A connection has started connecting to the remote server



active::  A connection has become active (able to service requests)

  *Note:* This trigger should not be configured for SQL since due to the limitation of
one query per connection, every SQL query results in the connection switching from
`active` to `full` and then back again.



connection_closed::  A connection has been closed.



connection_full::  A connection has become full.

A full connection is one which has reached the maximum number of requests per connection.

  *Note:* This trigger should not be configured for SQL as every query results in the
connection becoming full, due to the limit of one query per connection.



connection_inactive::  A connection has become inactive (unable to accept new requests)



connection_inactive_draining::  A connection has become inactive and is draining its requests.



connection_draining::  A connection is draining its outstanding requests



connection_draining_to_free:: A connection is draining its outstanding requests before feeing.



## Creating new triggers

Triggers are defined in the server source code. Those are the
only traps which are generated.

WARNING: You *cannot* add new traps by defining them in one of the sections
in this file.  New traps can be created only by editing both the
source code of the server *and* the MIBs. If you are not an expert
in C and SNMP, then creating new traps will be difficult.


== Default Configuration

```
snmp {
	trap {
		cmd = "/usr/bin/snmptrap -v2c"
		community = "public"
		agent = "localhost ''"
	}
}
snmptrap = "${snmp.trap.cmd} -c ${snmp.trap.community} ${snmp.trap.agent} FREERADIUS-NOTIFICATION-MIB"
trigger {
	server {
		start = `${snmptrap}::serverStart`
		stop = `${snmptrap}::serverStop`
		max_requests = `${snmptrap}::serverMaxRequests`
	}
	modules {
	}
#	pool {
#		args = "radiusdModuleName s '${.:name}' radiusdModuleInstance s '${.:instance}'"
#		connection_halted = `${snmptrap}::serverModuleConnectionHalted ${args}`
#		connection_init = `${snmptrap}::serverModuleConnectionInit ${args}`
#		connection_connecting = `${snmptrap}::serverModuleConnectionInit ${args}`
#		connection_active = `${snmptrap}::serverModuleConnectionUp ${args}`
#		connection_closed = `${snmptrap}::serverModuleConnectionDown ${args}`
#		connection_full = `${snmptrap}::serverModuleConnectionFull ${args}`
#		connection_inactive = `${snmptrap}::serverModuleConnectionInactive ${args}`
#		connection_inactive_draining = `${snmptrap}::serverModuleConnectionInactiveDraining ${args}`
#		connection_draining = `${snmptrap}::serverModuleConnectionDraining ${args}`
#		connection_draining_to_free = `${snmptrap}::serverModuleConnectionDrainingToFree ${args}`
#	}
}

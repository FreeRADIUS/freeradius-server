= BFD (Bidirectional Forwarding Detection)

The purpose of `BFD` is to quickly detect if a link is up or down.

We are using it to determine if a `peer` application is up or down.
For example, when two servers are configured in primary / secondary
mode, they should be set up as BFD peers.  They can then detect
when the other one goes down.

The code is in FreeRADIUS because we want to know if the *application*
is running. It doesn't matter if the link is up, or if the host system
is running. If the FreeRADIUS daemon is down, then we want to know ASAP.

NOTE: See also `raddb/trigger.conf`.  There are BFD-specific triggers
which are executed when the link is started, goes up, down, or is
administratively down.



## Default instance



### server bfd  { ... }

```
server other {
	namespace = bfd

```

Common configuration for the BFD state machine.

```
	bfd {

	}

```

#### listen { ... }

```
	listen {
		transport = udp

		udp {
```

ipaddr: IP address, or IPv6 address as normal.

```
			ipaddr = ${bfd_other}

```

port:: Port as normal.

```
			port = 3784

			only_state_changes = true

		}
	}

peer main {
	ipaddr = ${bfd_main}

	port = 3784

```

auth_type:: BFD Authentication method.

May be one of:

[options="header,autowidth"]
|===
| Option         | Description
| none           | no password, not recommended
| simple         | cleartext password in the packet, not recommended
| keyed-md5      | MD5 based, like  RADIUS style shared secret key
| met-keyed-md5  | similar to above
| keyed-sha1     | SHA1 based, like RADIUS style shared secret key
| met-keyed-sha1 | similar to above
|===

NOTE: The other side of the BFD connection has to have the same
kind of authentication set.

```
	auth_type = ${bfd_auth_type}

```

secret:: The secret key used for authentication.

If it starts with "0x", then it is treated as a hex string. This is recommended
for security.  The secrets should be `~16` octets long, and random.

```
	secret = "hello"

```

min_transmit_interval:: Minimum time interval to transmit.

```
	min_transmit_interval = 250ms

```

min_receive_interval:: Minimum time interval to receive.

```
	min_receive_interval = 250ms

```

max_timeouts:: Max number of timeouts before the session is declared dead.

```
	max_timeouts = 3

```

demand:: BFD Demand mode.

allowed values: {no, yes}

```
	demand = no
}

recv Admin-Down {
	ok
}

recv Down {
	ok
}

recv Init {
	ok
}

recv Up {
	ok
}

}
```

== Default Configuration

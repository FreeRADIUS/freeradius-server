See sample dhcp virtual server for details of
these options.



Packets received on the socket will be processed through one
of the following sections, named after the DHCP packet type.
See dictionary.dhcp for the packet types.

IP Address of the DHCP server

IP Address of the DHCP relay (where the reply should go to)
If requests are coming from an upstream relay, this will
already be set in the packet

Call the dhcpv4 module to do the relay

The DHCP Offer will come from the relay host


A repeat of the Discover section to handle Request packets
This can be repeated for Inform, Release and Decline as required.





== Default Configuration

```
#	This is a virtual server that handles DHCPv4 relaying
#	Only one server can listen on a socket, so you cannot
#	do DHCP relaying && run a DHCP server at the same time.
#	Configure an instance of the dhcpv4 module in order to use
#	this virtual server - that module provides DHCPv4 client
#	and relay functionality.
server dhcp.eth1 {
	namespace = dhcpv4
listen {
	type = Discover
	type = Request
	type = Inform
	type = Release
	type = Decline
	transport = udp
	udp {
		ipaddr = *
		port = 67
		interface = eth1
		src_ip_addr = 127.0.0.1
		broadcast = no
	}
}
recv Discover {
	&control.Net.Dst.IP := 192.0.2.2
	&request.Gateway-IP-Address := 192.0.2.1
	dhcpv4
	do_not_respond
}
recv Request {
	&control.Net.Dst.IP := 192.0.2.2
	&request.Gateway-IP-Address := 192.0.2.1
	dhcpv4

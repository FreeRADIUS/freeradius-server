A virtual server which is used to validate channel-bindings.


```
server channel_bindings {
```

Only the "recv Access-Request" section is needed.

```
	recv Access-Request {
```
In general this section should include a policy for each type
of channel binding that may be in use.  For example each lower
layer such as GSS-EAP (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7055[RFC 7055]) or IEEE 802.11I is likely to
need a separate channel binding policy.
```
	}
}

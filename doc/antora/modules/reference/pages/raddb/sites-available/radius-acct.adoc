Tiny virtual server for the new server processing sections.

Proxying is not yet possible.

Acct-Type { } is no longer supported.

```
server radius-acct {
namespace = radius

```

This is all the same as before

```
listen {
	type = acct
	ipaddr = *
	port = 3000

}

```

"preacct"

```
recv Accounting-Request {
	ok
}

```

"accounting"

```
send Accounting-Response {
	ok
}

} # server radius-acct
```

== Default Configuration

```

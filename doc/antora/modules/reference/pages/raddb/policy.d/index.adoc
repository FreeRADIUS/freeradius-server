# Policies

FreeRADIUS includes a powerful and advanced policy language. Policies can be run at any stage during the handling of a request:

* before authentication
* during authentication
* after authentication
* during accounting

Policies can be based on any attribute in a request or response, include checking both the existence of (or lack of) an attribute, and the contents of an attribute. They can filter out attributes, or re-write the contents of attributes.

Attributes can be created, deleted, or edited in a policy. Policies can leverage information in SQL, LDAP, flat-text files, or any other source of data.

Policies can be based on identities (user, group, or role), location (client IP, port, etc.), time (date, time of day), authentication method (PAP, CHAP, MS-CHAP, EAP type, etc.), or any other piece of information that is in a RADIUS packet or in a database. Policies can enforce VLAN capabilities, filtering QoS, etc.

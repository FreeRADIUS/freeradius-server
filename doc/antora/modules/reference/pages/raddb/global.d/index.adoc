= Global Configuration Items

Some modules have configuration which is _global_ to the server.

For example, the xref:raddb/mods-available/python.adoc[python] module has
the Python path set once for the server.  Due to how the underlying
Python APIs are written, this path cannot be configured on a
per-module basis.  If the configuration items were instead placed in
each module, then the settings could conflict, and the server would
have unpredictable behavior.

As a result, some modules have additional configuration items which
are in the `global.d` directory.  That way the settings are configured
once, and not in each module.

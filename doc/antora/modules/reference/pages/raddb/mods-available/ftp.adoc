# Ftp Module

The `ftp` module provides an xlat to retrieve files from FTP URIs.



## Configuration Settings

ftp { ... }::


max_resp_size:: Maximum accepted response size

If the server returns responses larger than this
they will be discarded.


binary:: Should the response be treated as binary data

If this is `yes` then the output data will be octets.
If it is `no` then the output data will be a string.


connection { ... }::  Configure how connection handles are
managed per thread.



Reusable connection handles are allocated in blocks.  These
parameters allow for tuning how that is done.

Since ftp requests are performed async, the settings here
represent outstanding ftp requests per thread.



min:: The minimum number of connection handles to
keep allocated.



max:: The maximum number of reusable connection handles
to allocate.

Any requests to allocate a connection handle beyond
this number will cause a temporary handle to be allocated.
This is less efficient than the block allocation so
`max` should be set to reflect the number of outstanding
requests expected at peak load.


cleanup_interval:: How often to free un-used connection
handles.

Every `cleanup_interval` a cleanup routine runs which
will free any blocks of handles which are not in use,
ensuring that at least `min` handles are kept.




connect_timeout:: Connection timeout (in seconds).

The maximum amount of time to wait for a new connection to be established.




## Expansions

The `rlm_ftp` module provides the following xlat function:

### %ftp.get(...)

Retrieve a file from an FTP URI

.Return: _string_ or _octets_

.Example

[source,unlang]
----
auth-token := %ftp.get('ftp://example.com/auth.txt')
----


== Default Configuration

```
ftp {
#	max_resp_size = 16k
#	binary = no
	connection {
		reuse {
			min = 10
			max = 100
			cleanup_interval = 30s
		}
		connect_timeout = 3.0
	}
}
```

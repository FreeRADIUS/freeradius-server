= Authentication Modules

The authentication modules verify user credentials.  They can do this
by checking them against an external system, or by implementing an
authentication protocol such as EAP.

There are many different types and methods of authentication. For
example, RADIUS supports PAP, CHAP, or EAP.  In many cases, datastores
such as LDAP can be used to check a users name and password.

In most cases, we recommend using a
xref:raddb/mods-available/doc/datastore.adoc[datastore]
(i.e. database) to store user credentials.  The server can then obtain
the credentials from the datastore, and run the authentication method
itself.

In rare cases, the datastore will not return the users credentials to
the server.  In that case, the server must send the users name and
password to the datastore, where it authenticates the user and returns
a "pass" or "fail" result.  This process almost always requires the
user to supply the server with a clear-text password.  Other
authentication methods such as CHAP or EAP will pretty much never work.

= Datastore Modules

Datastore modules store data.  In most cases, they are databases.  We
use the term "datastore" to mean that some of the storage methods are
not traditional databases, but they do still store data.

For example, the xref:raddb/mods-available/files.adoc[files] module
implements the widely-used RADIUS
xref:raddb/mods-config/files/users.adoc[users] file format.  It is not
a database, but it can store thousands or millions of user
credentials.

The available Datastore modules are:

= Language Modules

Language modules allow an administrator to use different languages within the server.

If the policies require basic if / then / else checks, or they require
simple attribute editing, we recommend using the
xref:unlang/index.adoc[Unlang Policy Language].  It is good enough for
nearly all common use-cases, and it is much faster than any of the
language modules.

The _only_ reason to use one of these language modules is when you
need to connect to an external API, and the API connector is a library
which is only available as a language-specific library.  In every
other case, xref:unlang/index.adoc[Unlang] will be simpler, and
faster.

The available Language modules are:

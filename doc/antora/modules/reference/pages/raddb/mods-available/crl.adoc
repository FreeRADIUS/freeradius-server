= CRL Module

The `crl` module provides CRL checking of TLS certificates.

Its primary use case is within the `verify certificate` processing
section of the `tls-session` virtual server when verifying client
certificates during EAP-TLS.



## Configuration Settings


source:: Where CRLs will be loaded from


dynamic:: Expansions for CRLs loaded dynamically from URIs in certificates

The CRL distribution point URI will be in the
attribute `CRL.CDP-URL` when this expansion is performed.


http:: Expansion to use when URI scheme is http

The `rest` module must be enabled to support this



ldap:: Expansion to use when URI scheme is ldap

If any CRLs need to be retrieved by LDAP queries
then configure and enable the `ldap` module to
support this.

If the URIs in CRL distribution points do not include
an LDAP host (i.e. they start ldap:///) then the
ldap module must be configured with the correct
server details to fetch the CRL from



ftp:: Expansion to use when URI scheme is ftp

If any CRLs need to be retrieved by FTP GET calls
then configure and enable the `ftp` module to
support this.



force_expiry:: Maximum time between expiring CRLs

If the `nextUpdate` attribute of a CRL is closer than this interval
then that will be used as the point that the CRL is expired.



force_delta_expiry:: Maximum time between expiring delta CRLs

This overrides `force_expiry` for delta CRLs.



early_refresh:: Time before `nextUpdate` which the CRL will be refreshed



ca_file:: File containing trusted CA, used to sign CRLs

This can reference the setting in the `eap` module, but in that
case, the eap module must be instantiate before the `crl` module
by adding it to the list of explicitly instantiated modules
in `radiusd.conf`



ca_path:: Directory containing trusted CAs, used to sign CRLs



trigger_rate_limit::

If triggers are enabled (either here or in trigger.conf),
should the trigger messages be rate limited.


trigger::  Xlats to run when specific CRL events happen

When configured here, they are specific to this module instance.
Alternatively global settings for all instances of the `crl`
module can be set in `triggers.conf` under the `modules` -> `crl`
section.

For triggers to be enabled, a top level `trigger` section must
exist.  Enable the line `$INCLUDE trigger.conf` in `radiusd.conf`
and if none of the triggers in there are required, comment them
out, leaving just the outer section.

Triggers can either be calls to execute programs or xlat expansions.
The examples below show the use of the `linelog` xlat.

In the "fetch..." triggers, the attributes from the request list
where the `crl` module is called are available.
The "expired" trigger only has `CRL.CDP-URL` available.


fetchuri:: A CRL URI is being requested



fetchfail:: Fetching a CRL URI failed



fetchbad:: Fetching a CRL URI returned bad data



expired:: A CRL has expired


== Default Configuration

```
crl {
	source {
		dynamic {
			http = %rest('GET', "%uri.safe(%{CRL.CDP-URL})")
#			ldap = %ldap(%ldap.uri.safe("%{CRL.CDP-URL}"))
#			ftp = %ftp.get(%uri.safe("%{CRL.CDP-URL}"))
		}
	}
#	force_expiry = 7d
#	force_delta_expiry = 1d
	early_refresh = 1h
#	ca_file = ${modules.eap.tls-config[tls-common].ca_file}
	ca_file = ${cadir}/rsa/ca.pem
#	ca_path = ${modules.eap.tls-config[tls-common].ca_path}
	ca_path = ${cadir}
#	trigger_rate_limit = yes
#	trigger {
#		fetchuri = %linelog("Fetching CRL from %{CRL.CDP-URL}")
#		fetchfail = %linelog("Failed fetching %{CRL.CDP-URL}: %{Module-Failure-Message}")
#		fetchbad = %linelog("Data returned from %{CRL.CDP-URL} was not valid")
#		expired = %linelog("CRL from %{CRL.CDP-URL} has expired")
#	}
}

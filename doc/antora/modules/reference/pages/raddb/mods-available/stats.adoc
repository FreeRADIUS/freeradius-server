= Stats Module

The `stats` module tracks packet statistics.

It should be listed *last* in any `send ... { }` section.

When listed in a `send` section, it will increment statistics for
input / output packets.

When listed in a `recv Status-Server` section, it will add global
server statistics to the packet.

See `dictionary.freeradius`, and the `FreeRADIUS-Stats4` attributes,
for a list of which attributes it adds.



== Configuration Settings

This module takes no configuration.

= DHCPv4 Module



## Configuration Settings

The DHCPv4 module is used as a relay.

For reach request, you should set `&control.Net.Dst.IP` and maybe
`&control.Net.Dst.Port` to the address of the next DHCPv4 server or
relay.

Packets MUST also have a `Gateway-IP-Address` option, otherwise
they will be dropped.  This module does not (yet) support receiving
replies from the DHCPv4 server.  Any packets sent to the outgoing
socket will be discarded.


ipaddr: The IP address we use for sending packets.

This MUST be an IPv4 address.  IPv6 addresses are not
supported for DHCPv4.



port:: The port we use for sending packets.

The default DHCPv4 client port is 68.  It should be changed
from this only for testing.



interface:: Interface to bind to.



max_packet_size:: The maximum packet size.

Packets which are larger than this will not be sent.

Useful range: 300..1500 or so.



send_buff:: How big the kernel's send buffer should be.


== Default Configuration

```
dhcpv4 {
	ipaddr = 127.0.0.1
#	port = 68
#	interface = eth0
#	max_packet_size = 576
#	send_buff = 1048576
}
```

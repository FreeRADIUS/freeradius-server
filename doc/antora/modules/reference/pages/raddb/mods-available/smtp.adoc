= SMTP Module

The `smtp` module can perform two actions:

When called in the `authenticate` section, it validates a users name
and password from request attributes against an SMTP server without
sending a mail.

When called with the method `mail` it will send an email.

The module can optionally perform a tls handshake, enabled with require_cert



tls { ... }:: Configure the tls related items which control
how FreeRADIUS connects to an SMTP server.


.Certificate validation options

Specifies how the certificate(s) presented by the
SMTP server are validated, and which certificates
(if any) to send to that SMTP server.

The options here behave the same as the options in
other `tls` sections in the server.



certificate_file:: PEM formatted file containing the certificate we present to the SMTP server

Specifies a certificate and any intermediary CAs we should send to the SMTP server.

This file should usually contain the client certificate file first, then any
intermediary signing CAs, shallowest (direct signee of the certificate_file)
to deepest (signed directly by the root CA).



ca_file:: PEM formatted file containing the chain
to validate the SMTP server's certificate.

Any certificate chain MUST be in order from server
certificate (first in the file) to intermediary CAs (second) to
Root CA (last in the file) as per https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4346#section-7.4.2[RFC 4346 Section 7.4.2] (see certificate_list)

Providing a complete certificate chain here is the
most common way of validating the certificate
presented by an SMTP server.



ca_issuer_file:: PEM formatted file containing the
CA that signed the SMTP server's certificate.

Specifies the certificate which directly signed
the certificate presented by the SMTPs server.

This configuration option can be used to prevent
certificates passing validation which were signed
by other intermediary CAs, or root CAs, in the
trusted certificate chain.



ca_path:: A directory containing multiple root CA certs named by their hash.

See the OpenSSL documentation for more details:
- https://www.openssl.org/docs/man1.1.0/man3/SSL_CTX_set_default_verify_paths.html
- https://www.openssl.org/docs/man1.1.1/man1/c_rehash.html

This configuration option should only be used when the SMTP server being contacted
is not known ahead of time (using a URL from an external source), and/or the CA used
to sign the SMTP server certificate is unknown.

If not set, then whatever libcurl has as its default will be used, which typically
will be the operating system's set of trusted CAs.  This will be visible in the debug
output when FreeRADIUS starts.



private_key_file:: PEM formatted file containing the private key for the specified `certificate_file`

This item must be specified if `certificate_file` is being used.



private_key_password:: Password used to decrypt the `private_key_file`.



random_file:: Source of random data used for various cryptographic functions.



check_cert:: Server certificate verification requirements.

May be one of:

[options="header,autowidth"]
|===
| Option | Description
| `no`   | Server certificate can be signed by any CA or be self-signed.
| `yes`  | Server certificate must be issued by one of the trusted CAs.
|===

Default is `yes`



request_cert:: Options for controlling how the
module requests TLS to the SMTP server.

May be one of:

[options="header,autowidth"]
|===
| Option | Description
| `demand`   | Require ssl validation to accept login
| `never`  | Do not try to establish ssl connection
| `allow`  | Try to establish ssl connection, continue even if it cannot
|===

default is 'allow'



check_cert_cn:: Server certificate CN verification requirements.

May be one of:

[options="header,autowidth"]
|===
| Option | Description
| `no`   | Server certificate CN can be any value.
| `yes`  | Server certificate CN matches the host in the URI.
|===

Default is `yes`



extract_cert_attrs:: Extract OIDs from presented certificates as OIDs.

Default is `no`



uri:: URI which will be used for connecting to the SMTP server.

The `smtp` module uses Curl (https://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/) to implement
the underlying mail protocols.  The URI should be in the form of:

`SCHEME://IP:PORT/`


  * `SCHEME` can be one of the SMTP protocols supported by Curl.
   i.e. smtp, smtps.
   If no `SCHEME` is given, it defaults to `smtp`.

  * `IP` is the IP address of the server.  It can be an IPv4 address,
  IPv6 address, hostname, etc.

  * `PORT` is optional, and will normally be chosen to be correct
  for the given `SCHEME`.

For more information, see the CURL documentation at:

https://ec.haxx.se/cmdline/cmdline-urls



timeout:: How long the module will wait, before giving up on the response
from the SMTP server.



authenticate: Configuration for verifying a users name and clear-text password
against an SMTP server.

This is not generally recommended, but is supported for cases where an LDAP server
is not available, and only an SMTP server is available.


username:: The users name when performing SMTP authentication.



password_attribute:: The users password when performing SMTP authentication



In most cases, the SMTP module will be used to send email.



username:: The name or login identifier to use when sending email.

If authentication is not required, it can be commented out/



password:: Password to use when sending email.



template_directory:: Directory where email templates are stored.

All file attachments should be given as a relative path
from this location. i.e. without a leading '/'.



Attachments:: File names to attach to the templates.

The filenames are relative to `template_directory`



envelope_address:: Set the `MAIL FROM:<envelope_address>`

If this is not set, `MAIL FROM` will be set from `sender_address`.



sender_address:: Set the body `FROM` address.

This can be different than the provided envelope_address.

If envelope_address is set, this can be formatted however
you want it to appear to the receiver.

If envelope_address is not set, the first element in
sender_address will be used as the envelope address.



recipients:: Email addresses to be set as recipients for the email

If recipients is set, then `bcc`, `cc`, and `to` will not
be automatically added to the email.  Only the list of
`recipients` will be used.



to:: Set the body `TO` header.

If `recepients` is not set, then messages will be sent to the `TO` address.



cc:: Set the body `CC` header.

If `recepients` is not set, then messages will also be sent to the `CC` addresses.



bcc:: Set the `BCC` recipients.

The local part may contain commas, the domain may not (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2821[RFC 2821])

Therefore, the first comma after the @ represents a new
address, and is not listed in the header of the email.

If `recepients` is not set, then messages will also be sent to the `CCC` addresses.



set_date:: Adds a Date: to the header, set to the time the request is received
Formatted as "Fri, 07 Aug 2020 00:57:37 -0400, (EDT)"
May be one of:

[options="header,autowidth"]
|===
| Option | Description
| `no`   | A Date: should be specified in the header, or left to the receiving mta
| `yes`  | A Date is formatted and added (recommended)
|===

Default is `yes`



header:: Additional headers to add to the messages.

Any `FROM`, `TO`, and `CC` should not be added here.  They are set in the configuration items above.

If no `DATE` header is provided, one will be added which
shows the time that the request was sent.

Non-standard mail headers may be set. Adhere to your MTA's
documentation


Headers are added with the given names and values, in the order listed here.



connection { .. }:: Configure how connection handles are
managed per thread.


Reusable connection handles are allocated in blocks.  These
parameters allow for tuning how that is done.

Since http requests are performed async, the settings here
represent outstanding http requests per thread.



min:: The minimum number of connection handles to
keep allocated.



max:: The maximum number of reusable connection handles
to allocate.

Any requests to allocate a connection handle beyond
this number will cause a temporary handle to be allocated.
This is less efficient than the block allocation so
`max` should be set to reflect the number of outstanding
requests expected at peak load.


cleanup_interval:: How often to free un-used connection
handles.

Every `cleanup_interval` a cleanup routine runs which
will free any blocks of handles which are not in use,
ensuring that at least `min` handles are kept.

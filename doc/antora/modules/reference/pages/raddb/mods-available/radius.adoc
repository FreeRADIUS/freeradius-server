= Radius Module

The `radius` module in v4 implements RADIUS proxying and
replication.  In v3, RADIUS proxying is a special kind of
configuration, with it's own load-balancing, fail-over etc.  That
configuration is now simpler in v4.  The outbound RADIUS proxying
is done by just another module: the `radius` module.
Load-balancing and redundant fail-over are handled by the
`load-balance` and `redundant` keywords.

In v4, the `radius` module most clearly maps to a `home_server` in
v4.  The `radius` module typically makes a connection from one
source IP address to a server at one destination IP/port.  It may
open multiple source ports, depending on how many packets are being
proxied.

## Recommendations

In most cases, the v3 configuration be moved to v4 without too many
problems.  For each `home_server foo { ... }` in v3, create a v4
module `radius foo { ... } `.  Copy over the IP address, port, and
secret configuration items.  When this step is finished, the bulk
of the basic work is done.

Converting a `home_server_pool foo { ... }` can be done by
creating a module in `mods-enabled`, either `load-balance foo {
... }`, or `redundant foo { ... }`.  i.e. the v3 module
configuration does not have any `instantiate` section.  You can
just list "virtual" modules directly in the `modules` directory!

The contents of the `load-balance` or `redundant` section will be
the list of home servers which will part of that `load-balance` or
`redundant` pool.

Then, anywhere you want to use a home server, just list it's name
in an `unlang` processing section.  Anywhere you want to list a
home server pool, just list it's name in an `unlang` processing
section.

Unlike v3, there is no `Proxy-To-Realm` attribute, or
`Home-Server-Pool`, or `Home-Server-Name`.  Instead, you just
configure a module (`radius`, or `load-balance`), and then use the
module anywhere you want to proxy packets.

In most cases, you can just set something like `Auth-Type :=
example.com`, and then have a section `authenticate example.com {
... }`, which contains the `radius` modules which do proxying.  See
link:../../../../../../sites-available/default.adoc[sites-available/default] for sample configuration which uses this
pattern.

## Behavior

The module adds a Proxy-State attribute to all proxied packets.
This `link:https://freeradius.org/rfc/rfc2865.html#Proxy-State[Proxy-State]` contains a 32-bit random number, which is unique
to this module.  This unique number helps to detect proxy loops.

The reply from home server is appended to the reply list for the
current packet.

WARNING: For security reasons, the module ensures that all proxied
`link:https://freeradius.org/rfc/rfc2865.html#Access-Request[Access-Request]` packets contain a `link:https://freeradius.org/rfc/rfc2869.html#Message-Authenticator[Message-Authenticator]`
attribute.  This behavior is *NOT* configurable, and *CANNOT* be
changed.  This behavior is part of the BlastRADIUS mitigations.

Any proxied packet (including `link:https://freeradius.org/rfc/rfc2866.html#Accounting-Request[Accounting-Request]`) can
receive a `Protocol-Error` response packet.  This packet
is an explicit `NAK` that something went wrong processing
the request.

Unlike v3, the server does not support any "pre-proxy" or
"post-proxy" processing sections.  Similarly, this module does not
support any "proxy" or "proxy-reply" list.  Instead, the current
request is proxied as-is, and the proxied reply is added to the
current reply list.  If you want to modify the proxied request
and/or proxied reply, then you should use a `subrequest` block to
create a child request.  That child request can then be modified
independently of the parent.  Any reply attributes will have to be
copied back manually to the parent request.

## Configuration Settings

The configuration settings of this module are similar to the
`home_server` settings in v3.

The module has the following return codes:

[options="header,autowidth"]
|===
| Code        | Description
| invalid     | Something went wrong sending the request,
                or the reply packet is invalid.
| ok          | the module received an `ack` (`link:https://freeradius.org/rfc/rfc2865.html#Access-Accept[Access-Accept]`,
                `link:https://freeradius.org/rfc/rfc2866.html#Accounting-Response[Accounting-Response]`, `CoA-ACK`, etc.)
| handled     | the module received an `link:https://freeradius.org/rfc/rfc2865.html#Access-Challenge[Access-Challenge]`
| fail        | there was no response to the proxied request
| reject      | the module received a `nak` (`link:https://freeradius.org/rfc/rfc2865.html#Access-Reject[Access-Reject]`, `CoA-NAK`, etc.)
| noop        | the module saw its own `link:https://freeradius.org/rfc/rfc2865.html#Proxy-State[Proxy-State]` attribute,
                and is will not proxy the request.  This behavior
                prevents proxy loops.
|===


mode:: What kind of client behavior is being used.

proxy - forward packets which are received from a NAS
- each packet has a Proxy-State attribute added.
- it looks for, and stops proxy loops
	- retransmissions are sent only when the NAS retransmits
- the module fails if it does not receive a reply

client - originate packet, and do retransmissions ourselves
- no Proxy-State is added.
- the module retransmits as needed
- the module fails if it does not receive a reply

replicate - send packets without waiting for a reply.
- no Proxy-State is added
- the module does not expect any reply
- all replies are discarded
- the module continues with "ok" immediately after
 sending the packet.

unconnected-replicate - replicate packets to dynamic destinations
- For unconnected UDP sockets only.
     - It MUST have `transport = udp`
- It MUST have `src_ipaddr = *` and no `src_port`
- You CANNOT use the module "in place" as with normal proxying.
- It is only supported via the function %replicate.sendto.ipaddr(ipaddr, port, secret)

dynamic-proxy - proxy packets to dynamic destinations
- https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7585[RFC 7585] dynamic DNS lookups are not supported
- It MUST have `src_ipaddr = *` and no `src_port`
- You CANNOT use the module "in place" as with normal proxying.
- Proxying is only supported via the function %proxy.sendto.ipaddr(ipaddr, port, secret)

The server can still be used to create (i.e. originate)
packets via this module when `mode = proxy` is set.  The
module can automatically detect the difference between
proxied packets and client packets it originates.
Originated packets are taken from the detail file, or
result when changing packet type (e.g. Accounting-Request
to Disconnect-Request), or when the current request is a
subrequest, and the parent request is from a different
protocol.

Note that there is no `mode = unconnected`, where the
module then both proxies packets, and replicates them.  The
need to track replies when proxying means that it's
difficult to both proxy and replicate at the same time.  As
a result, there are two "unconnected" modes, one for each
of "proxy" and "replicate".



transport:: Transport protocol.  Can be `udp` or `tcp`.



max_attributes:: Maximum number of attributes to decode in response.

Default is 255.



type:: List of allowed packet types.

The module will only send packets types which are listed
here.  Other types of packets will be ignored.  The main
purpose of the `type` configuration is to ensure that the
correct packets are being sent to the home server.  This
entry serves as a double-check against misconfigurations.

In v3, the `home_server` configuration of `auth`, `acct`,
or `auth+acct` is used to _find_ a home server.  That is,
when FreeRADIUS has an `link:https://freeradius.org/rfc/rfc2865.html#Access-Request[Access-Request]` packet in v3, it
proxies it by looking up a matching `home_server`.

In v4, proxying is done by listing the `radius` module in a
processing section, such as `authenticate radius { ... }`,
or `recv Accounting-Request { ... }`.  So unlike v3, the
module doesn't have to _find_ a proxy destination for a
particular kind of packet.  Instead, the administrator
_configures_ the module to send packets to a destination.

As a result, the module doesn't really care about what kind
of packets it sends.  It has a packet, a destination where
that packet should be sent, and it sends the packet.

In order to change packet types, see the `subrequest` keyword.

NOTE: `Status-Server` is reserved for connection signaling,
and cannot be proxied.

Unlike v3, all packet types are allocated from the same
8-bit ID space.  This change does not affect the majority
of RADIUS proxying, which only sends one type of packet.
This change does not affect the home server which receives
these packets, as the home server does not track IDs except
to correlate requests to replies.

The only visible difference, then, between v3 and v4 is
that in some cases, the new `radius` module will use more
source ports when proxying.

This change simplifies the implementation of the RADIUS
client.



require_message_authenticator::Require Message-Authenticator
in responses.

A server should include Message-Authenticator attribute as
the first attribute in responses to Access-Request packets.
This behavior mitigates against the BlastRADIUS attack.

However, not all servers follow this security practice.  As
a result, this module can be configured to either not
require, or require, Message-Authenticator.

If value is `auto`, then the module will automatically
detect the existence of Message-Authenticator in response
packets.  Once the module sees a Message-Authenticator, it
will automatically change the configuration internally to
`yes`.  This change prevents security "down-bidding"
attacks.

Allowed values: yes, no, auto

The default is `auto`.



response_window: If we do not receive any replies within
this time period, then start `zombie_period`



zombie_period:: If the home server does not reply to
packets within `response_window`, then `zombie_period`
starts.

When `zombie_period` starts, a connection is marked
`zombie`, and then is not used to send new packets.  If
there are no responses on this connection within
`zombie_period`, the module either closes the connection
(no `status_check` subsection), or starts pinging the home
server (`status_check.type = Status-Server`).



revive_interval:: If there are no status checks, mark the
home server alive after `revive_interval` timeout.

Some home servers do not support status checks via the
`Status-Server` packet.  Others may not have a "test" user
configured that can be used to query the server, to see if
it is alive.  For those servers, we have NO WAY of knowing
when it becomes alive again.  Therefore, after the server
has been marked dead, we wait a period of time, and mark
it alive again, in the hope that it has come back to
life.

If it has NOT come back to life, then the module will wait
for `zombie_period` before marking it dead again.  During
the `zombie_period`, ALL AUTHENTICATIONS WILL FAIL, because
the home server is still dead.  There is NOTHING that can
be done about this, other than to enable the status checks,
as documented above.

e.g. if `zombie_period` is 40 seconds, and `revive_interval`
is 300 seconds, the for 40 seconds out of every 340, or about
10% of the time, all authentications will fail.

If the `zombie_period` and `revive_interval` configurations
are set smaller, than it is possible for up to 50% of
authentications to fail.

As a result, we recommend enabling status checks, and
we do NOT recommend using `revive_interval`.

The `revive_interval` configuration is used ONLY if the
`status_check` subsection is not used.  Otherwise,
`revive_interval` is not necessary, and should be deleted.

Useful range of values: 10 to 3600



### Check the status of a connection

status_check { ... }:: For "are you alive?" queries.

If the home server does not respond to proxied packets, the
module starts pinging the home server with these packets.


type:: You can specify any type of request packet here,
e.g. 'Access-Request', 'Accounting-Request' or
'Status-Server'.

Status-Server is recommended as other packet types
may be interpreted incorrectly, or may ve proxied
to a remote server, which defeats the purpose of
the status checks.

If you specify another type of packet, it MUST be listed
as an allowed `type` above.



`Status-Server` packet contents are fixed and cannot
be edited.

For other packet types, you can set the contents
here.  The section MUST be set over
"&request.<attribute> = value", and anything else
will cause a parse error.

We RECOMMEND that you use packet contents which
lets the other end easily tell that they are not
"real" packets from a NAS.

The example here is for Access-Request.  The
contents will vary by other packet types.

The module will automatically update the contents
of the Event-Timestamp attribute to be the time
when the packet is sent.  The module will also
automatically add a Proxy-State attribute.

WARNING: Do NOT do SQL queries, LDAP queries, dynamic
expansions, etc. in this section.  The contents are
created when a connection is opened, and are not
changeable after that.



## Transport Protocols

The module supports multiple transport protocols.



### File Output

Write raw RADIUS packets (no IP or UDP header) to a file.
This transport can only be used for `mode = replicate`



### UDP Transport

Much like the v3 `home_server` configuration.


src_ipaddr:: IP we open our socket on.



Destination IP address, port, and secret.

Use `ipv4addr = ...` to force IPv4 addresses.
Use `ipv6addr = ...` to force IPv6 addresses.



interface:: Interface to bind to.



max_packet_size:: Our max packet size. may be different from the parent.



recv_buff:: How big the kernel's receive buffer should be.



send_buff:: How big the kernel's send buffer should be.



### TCP

The TCP configuration is identical to the `udp` configuration.



## Connection trunking

Each worker thread (see radiusd.conf, num_workers), has
it's own set of connections.  These connections are grouped
together into a "pool".

Much of the configuration here is similar to the old
connection "pool" configuration in v3.  However, there are
more configuration parameters, and therefore more control
over the behavior.


start:: Connections to create during module instantiation.

If the server cannot create specified number of connections during instantiation
it will exit.

Set to `0` to allow the server to start without the database being available.



min:: Minimum number of connections to keep open.



max:: Maximum number of connections.

If these connections are all in use and a new one is requested, the request
will NOT get a connection.



connecting:: Maximum number of sockets to have in the "connecting" state.

If a home server goes down, the module will close
old / broken connections, and try to open new ones.
In order to avoid flooding the home server with
connection attempts, set the `connecting` value to
a small number.



uses:: number of packets which will use the connection.

After `uses` packets have been sent the connection
will be closed, and a new one opened.  For no
limits, set `uses = 0`.



lifetime:: lifetime of a connection, in seconds.

After `lifetime` seconds have passed, no new
packets will be sent on the connection.  When all
replies have been received, the connection will be
closed.

For no limits, set `lifetime = 0`.

It is possible to use precise times, such as
`lifetime = 1.023`, or even qualifiers such as
`lifetime = 400ms`.



open_delay:: How long (in seconds) a connection
must be above `per_connection_target` before a new
connection is opened.

Parsing of this field is the same as for
`lifetime`.



close_delay:: How long (in seconds) a connection
must be below `per_connection_target` before a
connection is closed.



manage_interval:: How often (in seconds) the
connections are checked for limits, in order to
open / close connections.



connection { ... }:: Per-connection configuration.


connection_timeout:: How long to wait
before giving up on a connection which is
being opened.



reconnect_delay:: If opening a connection
fails, or an open connection fails,
we wait `reconnect_delay` seconds before
attempting to open another
connection.



request { ... }:: Per-request configuration.


per_connection_max:: The maximum number of requests
which are "live" on a particular connection.



per_connection_target:: The target number
of requests which are "live" on a
particular connection.

There can be a balance between overloading
a connection, and under-utilizing it.  The
default is to fill each connection before
opening a new one.



free_delay:: How long to wait before
freeing internal resources associated with
the connection.




## Retransmission timers.

Each packet can have its own retransmission timers.

The sections are named for each packet type. The contents
are the same for all packet types.



### Access requests packets


initial_rtx_time::  If there is no response within this time,
the module will retransmit the packet.

Value should be `1..5`.



max_rtx_time:: The maximum time between retransmissions.

Value should be `5..30`



[NOTE]
====
  * The following are maximums that *all* apply.

i.e. if any one of the limits is hit, the retransmission stops.
====



max_rtx_count:: How many times the module will send the packet
before giving up.

Value should be `1..20` _(0 == retransmit forever)_



max_rtx_duration:: The total length of time the module will
try to retransmit the packet.

Value should be `5..60`



### Accounting Packets

i.e. If you want `retransmit forever`, you should set:

  max_rtx_time = 0
  max_rtx_count = 0



### CoA Packets



### Disconnect packets



### Status-Server packets

The configuration here helps the module determine if a home
server is alive and responding to requests.

WARNING: The `Status-Server` packets CANNOT be proxied.



## Replication of Packets

The module supports replication of packets to new destinations at
run time.  In this context, replication means "send the packet, and
do not wait for the response".  This functionality is most useful
when copying large amounts of accounting data to multiple
destinations.

The module can then only be used as a dynamic expansion.  That is,
you cannot specify the `replicate` module directly in a processing
section.

### Usage

This module can only be used as a dynamic expansion.  Since the
module does not wait for any response, the expansion does not
return any value.

The module can be called from any processing section as follows:


The function takes three arguments:


This function allows the module to send packets to _any_
destination, where the destination is chosen dynamically at run
time.  The arguments to the function can be take from other
attributes, database queries, etc.


Generally you only want to replicate accounting packets.



We are not opening a socket from our server to their
server.  We are replicating packets.



For replicated packets, only UDP is supported.



### UDP Transport

For unconnected modes, only UDP is supported.


src_ipaddr:: The source IP address used by the module.



`src_port` cannot be used.  If it is used here, the
module will refuse to start.  Instead, the module
will open a unique source port per thread.

`secret` cannot be used.  If it is used, the value
will be ignored.



### Other Configuration

No other configuration items are supported when using
`mode = unconnected-replicate`.

The `pool` configuration is ignored, as is `status-check`,
along with all per-packet timeouts.



A dynamic proxy module



We are not opening a socket from our server to their
server.  We are replicating packets.



Both UDP and TCP are supported.



### UDP Transport


src_ipaddr:: The source IP address used by the module.



`src_port` cannot be used.  If it is used here, the
module will refuse to start.  Instead, the module
will open a unique source port per thread.

`secret` cannot be used.  If it is used, the value
will be ignored.



## Connection trunking

See above for documentation on connection trunking.


start:: Connections to create during module instantiation.

If the server cannot create specified number of connections during instantiation
it will exit.

Set to `0` to allow the server to start without the database being available.



min:: Minimum number of connections to keep open.



max:: Maximum number of connections.

If these connections are all in use and a new one is requested, the request
will NOT get a connection.



connecting:: Maximum number of sockets to have in the "connecting" state.

If a home server goes down, the module will close
old / broken connections, and try to open new ones.
In order to avoid flooding the home server with
connection attempts, set the `connecting` value to
a small number.



uses:: number of packets which will use the connection.

After `uses` packets have been sent the connection
will be closed, and a new one opened.  For no
limits, set `uses = 0`.



lifetime:: lifetime of a connection, in seconds.

After `lifetime` seconds have passed, no new
packets will be sent on the connection.  When all
replies have been received, the connection will be
closed.

For no limits, set `lifetime = 0`.

It is possible to use precise times, such as
`lifetime = 1.023`, or even qualifiers such as
`lifetime = 400ms`.



open_delay:: How long (in seconds) a connection
must be above `per_connection_target` before a new
connection is opened.

Parsing of this field is the same as for
`lifetime`.



close_delay:: How long (in seconds) a connection
must be below `per_connection_target` before a
connection is closed.



manage_interval:: How often (in seconds) the
connections are checked for limits, in order to
open / close connections.



connection { ... }:: Per-connection configuration.


connection_timeout:: How long to wait
before giving up on a connection which is
being opened.



reconnect_delay:: If opening a connection
fails, or an open connection fails,
we wait `reconnect_delay` seconds before
attempting to open another
connection.



request { ... }:: Per-request configuration.


per_connection_max:: The maximum number of requests
which are "live" on a particular connection.



per_connection_target:: The target number
of requests which are "live" on a
particular connection.

There can be a balance between overloading
a connection, and under-utilizing it.  The
default is to fill each connection before
opening a new one.



free_delay:: How long to wait before
freeing internal resources associated with
the connection.

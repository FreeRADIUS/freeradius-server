= Perl Module

The `perl` module processes attributes through a Perl interpreter.

  * Please see the `raddb/mods-config/perl/example.pl` sample.
  * Please see http://www.perl.org/docs.html for more information about the
Perl language.

NOTE: As of FreeRADIUS v4, the Perl subroutine names called when the `perl`
module is called are automatically derived from the section in which
they are called.

e.g. if `perl` is called in `recv Access-Request`, firstly a subroutine
`recv_access_request` will be looked for.  If that does not exist, then
a subroutine `recv` will be looked for.

This can be overridden by setting `func_recv_access_request` or `func_recv`
to point to a different subroutine name.

In addition the option `func_detach` can be used to set a subroutine to call
during shutdown.

Each subroutine called during a packet processing section is passed a
hash ref which represents the packet.

The hash contains 4 keys `request`, `reply`, `control` and `session-state`
which allow access to the pairs in those FreeRADIUS pair lists.

Nested attributes are represented by nested hashes, while leaf attributes
are represented by arrays, allowing access to individual instances of the
attribute.

For example, if the perl subroutine starts with `my $p = shift()`, then
attributes in the request can be accessed using syntax of the form:

[options-"header,autowidth"]
|===
| Perl syntax                         | FreeRADIUS attribute
| %p->{'request'}{'foo'}[0]           | request.foo
| %p->{'request'}{'baa'}{'baz'}[1]    | request.baa.baz[1]
| %p->{'request'}{'baa'}{2}{'baz'}[0] | request.baa[2].baz
|===

The interface between FreeRADIUS and Perl is mostly strings.

Attributes of type `string` are copied to Perl as-is.
They are not escaped or interpreted.

Attributes of type `octets` are copied to Perl as-is.
They are not escaped or interpreted.

Numeric attributes are passed as the appropriate Perl numeric type.

All other attributes are printed, and passed to Perl as a string value.

IP addresses are sent as strings, e.g. "192.0.2.25", and not as a 4-byte
binary value.  The same applies to other attribute data types.

Attributes can be set by assigning values to the array entries of leaf
nodes.  E.g.

$p->{'reply'}{'foo'}[0] = 'baa'

In addition, the Perl array functions `push`, `pop`, `shift` and `unshift`
can be used to add or remove instances of attributes.

The return codes from functions in the `perl_script` are passed directly back
to the server.  These codes are defined in `mods-config/example.pl`



## Configuration Settings


filename:: Module to load functions from.

The Perl script to execute when the module is called.
This is very similar to using the `exec` module, but it is
persistent, and therefore faster.



perl_flags::

Options which are passed to the Perl interpreter.

These are (mostly) the same options as are passed
to the `perl` command line.

The most useful flag is `-T`.  This sets tainting on.
Using this flag makes it impossible to leverage bad
User-Names into local command execution.

Delete this next line to allow people to pwn your
FreeRADIUS server.



func_detach:: Subroutine to call during server shutdown



Sample subroutine name overrides

These options cause the old FreeRADIUS v3 default subroutine
names to be used


config { ... }::

You can define configuration items (and nested sub-sections) in perl `config { ... }`
section.
These items will be accessible in the perl script through `%RAD_PERLCONF` hash.

For instance:

[source,perl]
----
$RAD_PERLCONF{'name'}
$RAD_PERLCONF{'sub-config'}->{'name'}
----


== Default Configuration

```
perl {
	filename = ${modconfdir}/${.:instance}/example.pl
	perl_flags = "-T"
#	func_detach = detach
#	func_recv_access_request = authorize
#	func_recv_accounting_request = preacct
#	func_send = postauth
#	config {
#		name = "value"
#		sub-config {
#			name = "value of name from config.sub-config"
#		}
#	}
}
```

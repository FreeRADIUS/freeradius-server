= WinModule

The `winbind` module authenticate PAP passwords against Microsoft Active
Directory or Samba, via the winbind API.

This module is for PAP authentication (where plaintext passwords
are sent in the `link:https://freeradius.org/rfc/rfc2865.html#User-Password[User-Password]` attribute) only. For authenticating
`mschap` requests against AD/Samba see the options available in the
`rlm_mschap` module.

NOTE: Samba version 4.2.1 or higher is required to use this module.



## Configuration Settings


username:: The username to pass to `winbind` for authentication.



domain:: The windows domain.

While not required to be set, it is likely that authentication will fail
if it is not set correctly.

This configuration option, as the username above, is also expanded before use.

If unset then winbind will be queried for the correct value. If you
actually want it blank it should be explicitly set here.



group { ... }:: Group membership checking.

Groups can be checked via the expansion `%winbind.group(<name>)`


search_username:: AD username to search for group searches.

This should generally not include a realm, so `Stripped-User-Name`
is likely the best attribute if it exists.



add_domain:: Include the domain in group searches.

When this is enabled, winbind_domain is prepended to the
username (as `domain\username`) before searching. This is
generally required.



.Reusable Handles

Reusable connection handles are allocated in blocks.  These
parameters allow for tuning how that is done.


min:: The minimum number of connection handles to
keep allocated



max:: The maximum number of reusable connection
handles to allocate.



cleanup_interval:: How often to free un-used
connection handles.


== Default Configuration

```
winbind {
	username = "%{&Stripped-User-Name || &User-Name}"
#	domain = ""
	group {
		search_username = "%{&Stripped-User-Name || &User-Name}"
#		add_domain = yes
	}
	reuse {
#		min = 10
#		max = 100
#		cleanup_interval = 30s
	}
}
```

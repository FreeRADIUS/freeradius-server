| Return code   | Description
| `fail`	| The operation failed.  Usually as a result of an
                  external dependency like a database being unavailable
                  or an internal error.
| `handled`     | The request has been "handled", no further policies
                  in the current section should be called, and the section
                  should immediately exit.
| `invalid`	| The request, or operation, was invalid.  In the case of
                  requests this usually indicates absent or malformed
                  attribute values.
| `noop`        | The operation did nothing.
| `notfound`    | A 'lookup' operation returned no results.
| `ok`          | Operation completed successfully but did not change any
                  attributes in the request.
| `reject`      | The operation indicates the current request should be
                  'rejected'.  What this actually means is different from
                  protocol to protocol.  It usually means that access to
                  the requested resource should be denied, or that the
                  current request should be NAKd.  Usually returned when
                  provided credentials were invalid.
| `updated`     | The operation completed successfully and updated one
                  or more attributes in the request.
| `disallow`    | Access to a particular resource is
                  denied. This is similar to `reject` but is the result
                  of an authorizational check failing, as opposed to
                  credentials being incorrect.
| `yield`       | Returned by an operation when execution of a request should
                  be suspended.

[NOTE]
====
In versions â‰¤ v3.0.x the `disallow` rcode was called `userlock`. `disallow` and
`userlock` have an identical meaning. `disallow` will be returned in any
instance where `userlock` was returned in v3.0.x

The shared secret is wrong. Fix it! RADIUS uses a shared secret, a key
security feature, to ensure that communications are secure across the
network and devices.  This is a password or key known only to the
client and server.

If you see this message, it means the shared secret on the client and
server don’t match. To resolve this issue, check that the shared
secret is identical on both the client and server.  In many cases, you
should just re-enter the shared secret on both sides.

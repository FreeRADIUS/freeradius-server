== The Shared Secret is Wrong.

When a packet fails to be verified, the shared secret is wrong. Fix
it!

RADIUS uses a 'shared secret' to authenticate clients and servers.
This is a key which is known only to the client and server.

When the secret doesn't match, the server cannot authenticate it, the
packet is invalid, and the server discards it.  The server also
produces an error in debug mode.  That error describes the specific
reason why the packet was discarded.

Whatever the reason or error message, the underlying cause is the
same. **The shared secret on the client and server are not the
same**. To resolve this issue, check that the shared secret is
identical on both the client and server.  In many cases, you should
just re-enter the shared secret on both sides.

= Packet too small

The RADIUS specifications say rhat packets must be at least 20 bytes
in size. If you see this error, it means that non-RADIUS packets are
being sent to the RADIUS port.

Find the system which is sending the non-RADIUS traffic, and update it
so that it does not send traffic to the RADIUS server.  Or, add a
firewall rule on the RADIUS server to block traffic from that source
IP address.

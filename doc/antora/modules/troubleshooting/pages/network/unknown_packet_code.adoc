= Unknown Packet Code

This error occurs when the network receives a RADIUS packet which is
not defined by the standards. Each RADIUS packet has a "code" field
that defines its type, like `Access-Request` or `Access-Accept`. The
Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) specifies valid codes in their
documents. These codes must be between 1 and 53. Any code outside this
range, such as 0 or above 53, is invalid and cannot be processed.

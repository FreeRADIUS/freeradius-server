= Unknown Packet Code

This error occurs when the network receives a RADIUS packet which is
not defined by the standards. Each RADIUS packet has a "code" field
that defines its type, like `Access-Request` or `Access-Accept`. The
Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) specifies valid codes in their
documents. These codes must be between 1 and 53. Any code outside this
range, such as 0 or above 53, is invalid and cannot be processed.

When an invalid code appears, it usually means two things. First, the
device or client sending the packet is not following the RADIUS
standards.  Perhaps the manufacturer didn’t implement the protocol
correctly, or has a bug in their software.

Second, the error might show that traffic not meant for RADIUS is sent
to the RADIUS port. This often happens because of a misconfigured
network or device. A network administrator may have set up a device to
send non-RADIUS traffic to the RADIUS port.  These packets will cause
the server to complain.

In both cases, the server cannot process the packet.  To fix this,
network administrators need to find the source of the problem, whether
it's a faulty client or misconfigured settings. They must ensure only
valid RADIUS packets reach the server. This may involve updating
software, adjusting network settings, or blocking non-RADIUS
traffic. By fixing the Unknown Packet Code error, administrators can
stabilize the network and prevent future problems.

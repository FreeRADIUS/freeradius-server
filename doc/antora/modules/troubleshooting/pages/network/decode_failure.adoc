= Failure Decoding the Packet

The message "Failure Decoding the Packet" means that the server cannot
process a packet which it has received. This failure may be caused by
one of the following:

* The server has run out of memory,
* There are malformed Vendor-Specific Attributes (VSAs) within the packet.
* The Type-Length-Value (TLV) is too deep.
* Unusual or unexpected packet structures cause packets to be malformed in some weird way.

In all these cases, the server discards the packet.

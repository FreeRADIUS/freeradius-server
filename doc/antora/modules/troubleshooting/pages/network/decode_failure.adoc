= Failure Decoding the Packet

The message "Failure Decoding the Packet"  means that the server can't interpret a received network packet. This failure may be caused by one of the following:

* The server has run out of memory, preventing it from processing the packet.
* There are malformed Vendor-Specific Attributes (VSAs) within the packet.
* The Type-Length-Value (TLV) is too deep.
* Unusual or unexpected packet structures cause packets to be malformed in some weird way.

In all these cases, the server can't process the packet because its format is invalid or corrupt.

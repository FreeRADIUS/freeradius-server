= Did not find request which matches response

The xref:reference:raddb/mods-available/radius.adoc[radius] module shows this error message when it sends packets. The issue may occur when the server:

* Sent a request.
* Never received a response.
* Timed-out or gave up on the original request.
* Finally received a response.

This often indicates network issues and / or packet loss. Packets may be lost or delayed by the next hop server. If the server over 30 seconds to reply, the original request fails. The late response cannot be linked to it.

To resolve this, check the network for reliability and bandwidth availibility. Ensure the next hop server responds quickly, with minimal packet loss and delays.

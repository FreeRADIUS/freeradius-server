= IO Error

An IO error usually indicates a temporary problem with the local
operating system or network.  For example, it can be due to
permissions error, failure of a network interface, routing failure,
etc.  It should happen rarely.

As the error here is due to the network or operating system, you
generally cannot fix it by updating the server configuration.  You
will have to track down the source of the error, which is outside of
the server.

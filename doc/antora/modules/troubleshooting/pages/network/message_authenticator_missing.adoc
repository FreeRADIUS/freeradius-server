= Message-Authenticator is missing

This error happens when the Message-Authenticator attribute is missing
from the packet. This attribute is used to check the integrity
and authenticity of RADIUS messages.

The `Message-Authenticator` attribute acts like a digital signature
for RADIUS messages. It verifies that the messages are
genuine, and are from a genuine client.

This error can stem from a misconfigured RADIUS client.

TBD: EAP requires Message-Authenticator, as does BlastRADIUS

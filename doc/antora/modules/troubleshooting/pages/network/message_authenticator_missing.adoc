= Message-Authenticator is missing

This error happens when the Message-Authenticator attribute is missing from the RADIUS packet. This attribute is used to check the integrity and authenticity of RADIUS messages. The Message-Authenticator stops malicious attacks. Without it, the server faces serious risks, like the BlastRADIUS attack. BlastRADIUS attacks happen when the Message-Authenticator is missing or used incorrectly. Unauthorised users gain access to network resources and services, putting the system's security and integrity at risk.

The Message-Authenticator attribute acts like a digital fingerprint for RADIUS messages. It verifies that the messages are genuine. Sending a packet without it is like not having a tracking number. It's difficult to check who sent it or what's inside. This error indicates a potential security risk when it appears. The packet may not be trustworthy or follow best practices. This highlights the urgency to fix the issue to prevent security breaches.


This error can stem from a misconfigured RADIUS server or a faulty client. To resolve it and avoid future problems, understanding the cause is important.

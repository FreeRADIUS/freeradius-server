= Attribute Overflows the Packet

The client is either completely broken, or the packet is not RADIUS.

The server receives a network packet with an attribute that isn't the
right length for the RADIUS protocol. The client sending the packet is
broken and is sending invalid packets of the wrong size.

Update the client to stop sending non-RADIUS packets to the RADIUS
server.

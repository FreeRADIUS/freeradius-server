= Failed binding to socket

This error message is produced when the server cannot open a socket on
the specified port.  There are a few reasons why this can happen, but
the most common one is that there is already another instance of
FreeRADIUS running.

**Cause:** You are trying to run the server in
xref:ROOT:debugging/radiusd_X.adoc[debug mode], without stopping the
server that is running in the background.

**Action:** Stop the server which is running in the background, and
you can then run it in debug mode.

**Cause:** The server does not have permission to open the given socket/port.

**Action:** Check that the server has the correct UID/GID permissions.

**Action:** Check that something like SeLinux is not preventing the
server from opening sockets.

= Packet Too Large

The "Packet Too Large" error occurs when a client sends a RADIUS
packet with too much data. The RADIUS protocol limits packet size to
4k.  If a packet exceeds this limit, the server can't process it and
reports an error.

This error means that the client is broken or is misconfigured.  To
fix the error, check the client's configuration and make sure that it
is sending valid RADIUS packets.

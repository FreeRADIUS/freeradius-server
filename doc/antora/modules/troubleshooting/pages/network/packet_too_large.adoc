= Packet Too Large

The "Packet Too Large" error occurs when a client sends a RADIUS packet with too much data. The RADIUS protocol limits packet size to 4k, ensuring reliable communication and interoperability between network devices. If a packet exceeds this limit, the server can't process it and reports an error.

This error means that the client is broken/misconfigured. Either the client sends too much data or doesn't follow the protocol guidelines. To fix this, check the client's setup and make sure it meets the RADIUS packet size limits.

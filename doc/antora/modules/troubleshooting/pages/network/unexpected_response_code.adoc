= Unexpected response code

Each request sent has only a few valid responses that can be processed successfully. The next hop, such as a server or device, can send a bad or wrong response. When sending a request within a network protocol, only a limited set of responses is expected from the recipient. The invalid or incorrect response may be due to misconfiguration, software bugs, or unexpected network behavior.

Receiving a bad or wrong response can disrupt normal operations and may need troubleshooting to find the cause and ensure systems communicate properly.

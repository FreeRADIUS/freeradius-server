= Unexpected response code

Each request sent has only a few valid responses that can be processed
successfully. The next hop, such as a proxy or home network can,
however send anything in the response.  This capability means that
it's possible for the next hop to send (for example) a
`Accounting-Response` reply the local server sent an `Access-Request`.

The invalid or incorrect response may be due to misconfiguration, or
software bugs.  The problem is caused by the next hop server which is
sending the bad response, not by the local server which is received it.

Receiving a bad or wrong response will cause the server to ignore the
response, as no valid response was received.  The solution is to
contact the administrator of the next hop server, and ask them to
correct the issue.

= Too many attributes

This error means that the client is sending too much information in a
packet.  It is due either to a misconfigured client or a possible
attack on the server. Either way, you should check what the client is
sending via `tcpdump` or `wireshark`, before changing the
server configuration.

The default value for `max_attributes` is high enough for most common
use cases. However, if you do increase this limit, be careful. It
might make the server vulnerable to resource exhaustion attacks.

Each `listen` section has a `max_attributes` setting to limit the
number of attributes that can be included in a single request. By
enforcing this limit, the server protects itself from clients that
might try to overload it.

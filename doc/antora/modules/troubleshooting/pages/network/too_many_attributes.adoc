= Too Many Attributes

Each `listen` section has a `max_attributes` configuration.  This
prevents malicious clients from consuming large amounts of memory on
the server for each request.

The value is large enough for nearly all common use-cases.  Take care
before increasing it.

If you see this error, it's likely that a client is either malicious,
or misconfigured.

= Too many attributes

If you see an error about max_attributes, it usually means a client is sending too many attributes. It's probably due to a misconfigured client or a possible attack on the server. Either way, check what the client is doing before changing the configuration.

The default value for max_attributes is high enough for most common use cases. However, if you do increase this limit, be careful. It might make the server vulnerable to resource exhaustion attacks.

Each `listen` section has a `max_attributes` setting to limit the number of attributes that can be included in a single request. By enforcing this limit, the server protects itself from clients that might try to overload it. For example, malicious clients that consume large amounts of memory on the server for each request.

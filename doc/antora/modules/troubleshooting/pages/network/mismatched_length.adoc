= Header 'Length' does not match received packet length

The RADIUS protocol defines a header with a 'Length' value to indicate the packet's size. The packet header's 'Length' field shows a size that does not match the actual packet size.  If this value and the packet's actual size do not match, the packet is likely malformed or not a valid RADIUS packet.

Discrepancies can occur because of network errors, misconfigured clients, or malicious activity. To be safe, we recommend blocking the source IP address to prevent any issues or attacks.

= Header 'Length' does not match received packet length

The RADIUS protocol defines a header with a 'Length' value to indicate
the packet's size. The packet header's 'Length' field shows a size
that does not match the actual packet size.  If this value and the
packet's actual size do not match, the packet is likely malformed or
is not a valid RADIUS packet.

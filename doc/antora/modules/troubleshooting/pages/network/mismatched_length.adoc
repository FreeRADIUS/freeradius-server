= Header 'Length' does not match received packet length

The RADIUS protocol defines a header with a 'Length' value to indicate
the packet's size. The packet header's 'Length' field shows a size
that does not match the actual packet size.  If this value and the
packet's actual size do not match, the packet is likely malformed or
is not a valid RADIUS packet.

Discrepancies can occur because of clients sending non-RADIUS traffic
to the RADIUS server, or possibly an attack. To be safe, we recommend
blocking the source IP address to prevent any issues or attacks.

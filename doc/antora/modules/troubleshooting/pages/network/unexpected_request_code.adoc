= Unexpected Request Code

This error occurs when the RADIUS client and server do not have a
common configuration.  Each listen section specifies which RADIUS
requests that the server accepts. If a client sends a request which is
not listed in the `listen` section configuration, the server will
reject it and show an "Unexpected Request Code" error.

A key aspect of the RADIUS protocol is that it does not have any way
to negotiation capabilities between the client and server. This is
different from many other protocols. For example, HTTP allows a client
to send an OPTIONS request to check a server's capabilities. In
contrast, a RADIUS client cannot discover which packet types a server
will accept. This means that an administrator has to manually update
the configuration if there’s a mismatch.

To fix an Unexpected Request Code error, you have two options. First,
reconfigure the client to send only the packet types that the server
expects. This may involve updating the client’s software or adjusting
its configuration files. This ensures the client works within the
limits set by the server's listen section.

You can also change the server's `listen` section to list the packet
types sent by the client.  See the individual `listen` section for how
this is done.

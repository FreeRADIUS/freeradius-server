= Attribute has Invalid Length

The server receives a network packet with an attribute that isn't the right length for the RADIUS protocol. The client sending the packet is broken and is sending invalid packets of the wrong size.

Also, the data the server receives may not be a valid RADIUS packet. These packets may be some other network traffic that is unrelated or corrupted. In either case, the server can't process the packet as a valid RADIUS message because the attribute length is incorrect.

= Packet fails verification

include::partial$secret_wrong.adoc[]

If a packet fails verification, then the serce will refuse to process
the packet.  It could be a forgery, attack, or a misconfiguration/

An example is when a network administrator sets up a RADIUS client
with a shared secret. But they forget to update the server with the
same secret. When the client tries to authenticate, the packet won't
be verified, and authentication fails.

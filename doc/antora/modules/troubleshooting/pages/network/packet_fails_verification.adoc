= Packet fails verification

include::partial$secret_wrong.adoc[]

If a packet fails verification, the server can't confirm if the packet is authentic, so the authentication process fails. The mismatch can happen during setup or password updates not being the same.

An example is when a network administrator sets up a RADIUS client with a shared secret. But they forget to update the server with the same secret. When the client tries to authenticate, the packet won't be verified, and authentication fails.

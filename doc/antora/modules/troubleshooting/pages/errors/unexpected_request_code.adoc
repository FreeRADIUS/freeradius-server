= Unexpected Request Code

Each `listen` section accepts only a limited number of packet types.
This means that the client is sending packets that the server doesn't
expect to receive.

Since there is no negotiation in RADIUS, the client has no way of
knowing that the server is configured to receive.  Fix either the
client to not send those packets, or fix the server to accept those
packets.

[[simultaneous-use]]
= Configuring users for limited simultaneous access

*Goal:* To prevent a user from having more than one login session at a
time.

*Time:* 20-35 minutes

*Files:*

- `etc/raddb/users`
- `etc/raddb/mods-available/radutmp`
- `/var/log/radius/radutmp`

For this exercise, you are assumed to have previously worked
through, and be familiar with, the accounting exercise from
xref:accounting.adoc[Accounting], and to have an entry in the file, as given the
exercise in xref:new_user.adoc[New User], for user "bob".

In this exercise, youwill work through an example of a user
logging into the server, and then attempting a simultaneous login for a
second session, while still logged in for the first session.

You should run the `bob-login-one.sh` and `bob-acct-start.sh`
scripts, to simulate a successful user login. You should use the
`radwho` program to verify that the server knows that the user is logged
in.

You should then run the `bob-login-two.sh`, and observe that the
second authentication request succeeds. The login record should be
removed through running the `bob-acct-stop.sh` script, and you
should use the `radwho` program to verify that no one is currently
logged in.

you should now read the `Simultaneous-Use` file in the
documentation directory, to determine how to limit a user to only one
login at a time. The "bob" entry in the file should then be edited, to
add the limitation that "bob" may only have one login session at a
time.

The scripts `bob-login-one.sh` and `bob-acct-start.sh` should be run
again, to simulate a successful user login. The `bob-login-two.sh`
script should then be run, to verify that the second simultaneous
authentication attempt fails.

After running the `bob-acct-stop.sh` script, you should run the
`bob-login-two.sh` script again, to verify that the other login attempt
is now permitted to succed.

== Questions

1.  Why is it useful to prevent a user from having more than one
simultaneous login session?
2.  How would you configure `Simultaneous-Use` with an SQL database?
3.  What are the benefits of using an SQL database for
`Simultaneous-Use`, over the `radumtp` file?
4.  How does `Simultaneous-Use` affect users with multiple "bonded"
lines, like MPP, or ISDN?
5.  What would happen if the user tried to log in a second time, before
the accounting start packet was received?

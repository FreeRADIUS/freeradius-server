Unlang `update` blocks are used to update one or attributes in one
of the server's xref:reference:unlang/list.adoc[attribute lists].

In previous tutorials we've used the `files` modules, and the authorize
methods of authentication modules such as `pap` and `chap` to alter how
the server processes requests by setting a `Auth-Type` value.
Here, we will emulate that behaviour using the policy language.

* Create a condition (_condition 1_) to execute policy code if
the `&User-Name` in the request is 'bob'.
* Within that condition block, set the control attribute `&Password.Cleartext`
to be 'hello', and instruct the server to run the the `authenticate { ... }`
subsection for `pap`.
* Use the `bob.sh` script to verify that you see an `Access-Accept` returned
despite the `files` module not being called.

Using additional conditions and update blocks, emulate the logic implemented
using the files module in the xref:matching_users.adoc[Matching Users]
exercise.

To recap:

* If an incoming request contains a `&User-Name` attribute with the value
  'bob', and contains and attribute `&Framed-Protocol` with value `PPP`
  (_condition 2_), reply with a `&Framed-IP-Address` attribute with the value
  `192.168.10.12`.
* If an incoming request contains a `&Service-Type` attribute with a value
  of `Framed-User` (_condition 3_), reply with a `&Framed-Route` attribute
  assigning a default route of `192.168.10.1` (`0.0.0.0/0 192.168.10.1 1`) and
  a `&Framed-IP-Netmask` attribute with a value of `255.255.255.0`.

Again test the server with username "bob" and password "hello". Use the
debug output of the server to see which unlang conditions evaluated to
true.  You may use `radclient` or the `bob.sh` script to send the packets.

Perform other authentication tests, adding the appropriate attributes to
the test requests to exercise the different conditions. If you already have
test packets from the xref:matching_users.adoc[Matching Users] exercises,
you may use those, otherwise continue until you have packets that will match:

* conditions 1 and 2, but not 3.
* conditions 1 and 3, but not 2.
* conditions 1, 2, and 3.

== Questions

1.  What are the advantages of unlang over the files module when creating
    policies?
2.  What are the advantages of the files modules over unlang?  Are there
    any situations where you think the files module might be better suited
    to a task than unlang?
3.  Can you think of any efficiencies the users module might have over
    multiple conditions, where policies are being assigned to many different
    users?

include::partial$unlang_start.adoc[]

The server includes a number of instances of the
xref:raddb:mods-available/always.adoc[always] module.  These are used to set
return codes during policy evaluation.

For example, if the `ok` always module instance is called, the `ok` return code
will be returned, and subject too priority comparisons, will be set as the
return code for the request.

One of the most common reasons for overriding return codes is to implement
special behaviour on failure.

To minimise external dependencies, for this exercise we will use the
xref:raddb:mods-available/sometimes.adoc[sometimes] module to simulate an
unreliable external database.

This module will return a specified xref:reference:unlang/return_codes[return code] 50%
of the time.

Create an instance of the sometimes module called `bad_ldap`.

Add unlang statements such that if the module returns `noop`, then a
`&control.Password.Cleartext = 'hello'` attribute pair is added to the request,
and the return code is set to `updated`.

Run three test requests using `bob.sh`, you should see that at least one request
fails (though it may not as sometimes is truly random).

Now add a policy to handle the `fail` return code of the sometimes module by
executing the `files` module to provide an alternative source of credentials.

[TIP]
====
You may need to modify the return code priorities of the
xref:raddb:mods-available/sometimes.adoc[somtimes] module.
====

If the policies are correct you will see that FreeRADIUS returns an
`Access-Accept` 100% of the time.

1.  Why might you need to override the return code priorities of the
    sometimes module?
2.  Looking through the unlang keyword list, do you see any of keywords
    that might produce similar fail-over behaviour as the behaviour
    configured above xref:reference:unlang/keywords.adoc[Keywords].

= Advanced Configuration

This section organizes documentation topics related to connectivity and interoperability in FreeRADIUS. It includes guides on xref:eap.adoc[EAP] (Extensible Authentication Protocol) and its variants-EAP-MD5, EAP-TTLS, EAP-PEAP, and EAP-TLS-which are commonly used for secure network authentication.

There are also sections on xref:sql.adoc[SQL integration], including managing xref:sql_user.adoc[SQL users], which is useful for storing and retrieving user data from databases. Finally, it covers xref:proxy.adoc[proxying] features, with dedicated guides for proxy receive, fail-over, and load balancing, helping administrators configure and optimize network traffic routing and redundancy.

Each entry linksto a detailed page and provides additional guidance and step-by-step instructions, making it easier for users to quickly find the information they need for more complex or advanced operations:

= Configuring a server to proxy requests

*Goal:* To configure the server to proxy packets to a remote (home)
RADIUS server and to perform test authentications against both the
proxy server and the home server.

*Time:* 15-25 minutes

*File:*

- `etc/raddb/proxy.conf`

*Diagram:*

For this exercise, you will configure a RADIUS server to proxy
requests to a home RADIUS server that is run by another user
(the uber user)).

You will configure a realm, called "realm1" in the
`raddb/proxy.conf` file. This realm will be proxied to the RADIUS server
administered by the uber user, who will supply the IP address, port,
and shared secret used by their RADIUS server. The entry for the home
server in `proxy.conf` will be configured to "strip" the realm name
from the incoming request.

The entry from the exercise in
xref:new_user.adoc[New User] for user "bob", in the
"users" file will be used in this exercise.

The example packets `bob.sh` and `bob@realm1.sh` may be used in this
exercise.

You should verify that authentication requests for user "bob"
to their RADIUS server result in authentication accept replies and that
the request was not forwarded to the home RADIUS server. You
should then use the `bob@realm1.sh` script to attempt an authentication
request to their RADIUS server, which will then be proxied to the home
server.

Once you have verified that authentication requests are proxied
to the home server and that you have received an authentication accept, the
uber user will halt the home server. The users should then
re-attempt the `bob@realm1.sh` authentication request to their server.
They should then observe the resulting behavior of their server, as it
attempts to proxy to a home server that does not respond.

== Questions

1.  How would you configure "proxy.conf" so that "realm1" was not
proxied, but was instead handled by the local RADIUS server?
2.  Will it make any difference for the home server if the request sent
to the proxy contains CHAP-Password instead of User-Password?
3.  Since the User-Password is encrypted with the RADIUS shared secret,
what happens to it when a request is proxied?

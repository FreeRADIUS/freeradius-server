= Multiple instances of a module

*Goal:* To configure the server to have multiple instances of a module.

*Time:* 10-20 minutes

*File:*

- `/etc/raddb/mods-available/detail`

In this exercise, we will configure the server to use two independent
``databases'' (here, detail files) for recording accounting data. These
databases will use the same `detail` module, but with two different
configurations. The `detail` module logs plain-text information about
the request to a local file and is therefore an easy module to use for
demonstration purposes.

The first step is to configure the server to have two instances of the
`detail` module. The first instance should log requests to a different
file for each user name. The second should log requests to a different file
for each date. The following information should be added to the
`/etc/raddb/mods-available/detail` file.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
detail byname {
	filename = ${radacctdir}/byname/%{%{User-Name}:-none}
	permissions = 0600
}

detail bydate {
	filename = ${radacctdir}/bydate/%Y-%m-%d
	permissions = 0600
}
--------------------------------------------------------------------

In the module configurations contained within `/etc/raddb/mods-available/*`,
each module may have two names. The first name is the name of the dynamically
loadable module that implements that functionality. The second (optional) name
is the name of an additional instance of the module. In this case, the `detail`
module has two additional instances, `byname` and `bydate`. These instance names
can be used in the `authorize`, `accounting`, etc. sections, just like a
normal module name.

You should now add the two modules to the list of modules in the
`authorize` section. Start the server and verify that it is
`Ready to process requests.`

Send the server a test `Access-Request` packet (`bob.sh`). Verify that
the client receives a response packet and that the server is using the
two modules to log the request.

Verify that the request was logged to two different files by examining
them:

[source, bash]
------------------------------------------------
$ more /var/log/radius/radacct/byname/*
$ more /var/log/radius/radacct/bydate/*
------------------------------------------------

Once you have verified that the files exist and that the correct
information is logged in them, you may stop the server.

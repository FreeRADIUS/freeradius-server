Regular expressions are an extremely powerful tool in the 'unlang' policy
language.  They provide both validation capabilities, allowing users
to check the format of incoming attributes, and substring extraction
(via capture groups).

If you've completed the xref:proxy.adoc[Proxy] exercise you'll have
used the `suffix` module to split an incoming `&User-Name` value into
its components and setup the request for proxying.

Create an unlang version of "suffix" that splits an incoming `&User-Name` into
two components on the "@" separator.

The first component should be written to the `&request.Stripped-User-Name`
attribute and the second component should be written to the
`&control.Stripped-User-Domain` attribute.

Use `bob@realm1.sh` and `bob@realm2.sh` to test your new policy to ensure
it works as expected.

If you've completed the xref:proxy.adoc[Proxy] tutorial and have test
realms setup, modify the policy code you have just written to proxy
the request to the realm specified in the `&User-Name` attribute.

== Questions

1.  Regular expressions can contain attribute expansions.  Given that
    all supported regular expression libraries support pre-compilation
    of expressions, why would regular expressions containing expansions
    be avoided when the server being deployed will be under heavy load?
2.  Why might you want to re-implement functionality offered by modules
    in unlang?
3.  What is an advantage of using expression based string splitting
    over the suffix module?

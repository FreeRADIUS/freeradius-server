= Virtual Servers

*Goal:* To understand how to create and use a new virtual server.

*Time:* 20-30 minutes

*File:*

- `etc/raddb/sites-enabled/virtual`

*documentation page:* raddb/sites-available/README

A "virtual server" is a configuration file that contains the
following sections:

- *listen* Defines a new socket.
- *authorize* The authorization section
- *authenticate* The authentication section
- *post-auth* The post-authentication section
- *pre-proxy* The pre-proxy section
- *post-proxy* The post-proxy section
- *preacct* The pre-accounting section
- *accounting* The accounting section

Create a new file `raddb/sites-enabled/virtual`. Put the following text
into it:

-----------------------------------------------
listen {
    ipaddr = 127.0.0.1
    port = 18273   # some random 5 digit number
    type = auth
}

authorize {
    &control.Clearext-Password := "hello"
    pap
}

authenticate {
    pap
}
-----------------------------------------------

Start the server in debugging mode, and use `radtest` to send a PAP
authentication request to the server at the port defined above.

== Questions

1.  What happens when you try to use CHAP or MS-CHAP? Why does this result occur?
2.  How can you make that virtual server use CHAP or MS-CHAP?
3.  What happens when you try different User-Names? Why does this result occur?
4.  How can you make the above configuration authenticate different
users via different passwords?

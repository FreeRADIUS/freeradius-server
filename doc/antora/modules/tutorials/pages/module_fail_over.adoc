= Module Fail-Over

*Goal:* To configure the server to use a "backup" module if a
"primary" module fails.

*Time:* 15-25 minutes

*Files:*

- `etc/raddb/mods-available/detail`
- `usr/share/doc/freeradius*/configurable_failover`
- `/var/log/radius/radacct/detail1`
- `/var/log/radius/radacct/detail2`

When the server uses an external database to find user authentication
information or to log accounting requests, that database may sometimes
fail temporarily. This situation is similar to the situation seen in the exercise
in xref:proxy_failover.adoc[Proxy Failover], where proxied
requests "fail-over" to a backup RADIUS server when the primary
RADIUS server does not respond.

In this exercise, we will configure the server to use two "databases"
(here, detail files) for recording accounting data. We will simulate the
failure of one database by changing the file permissions on the first
detail file, and we will verify that accounting requests are logged to the
second detail file.

The first step is to configure the server to have two instances of the
`detail` module. The following information should be added to the
`etc/raddb/mods-available/detail` file:

--------------------------------------------------
detail detail1 {
	filename = ${radacctdir}/detail1
	permissions = 0600
}

detail detail2 {
	filename = ${radacctdir}/detail2
	permissions = 0600
}
--------------------------------------------------

In the file `configurable_failover` in the documentation directory,
there is a section titled "More Complex Configurations". This section contains a
sample entry for the "accounting" section of `etc/raddb/sites-available/default`.
The sample entry is a "group" with configurable fail-over between two modules named
`detail1` and `detail2`. Copy the "group" section to the start of the
`accounting` section in your `etc/raddb/sites-available/default` file.

Now start the server and verify that it is `Ready to process requests.`

Send the server a sample accounting packet (`bob-acct-start.sh`). Verify
that the client receives an accounting response packet and that the
server is using the `detail1` module to log the request.

Verify that the `detail1` file contains the accounting request by
examining it:

[source, bash]
-----------------------------------------------
$ more /var/log/radius/radacct/detail1
-----------------------------------------------

Also, verify that the `detail2` module is not referenced in the
debugging messages of the server when the request is processed. Check
that the `detail2` file does not exist:

[source, bash]
---------------------------------------------
$ ls /var/log/radius/radacct/detail2
---------------------------------------------

The command should fail with an error like "file not found."

Now, simulate a database failure by changing the permissions on the
file so that the server may not access it:

[source, bash]
----------------------------------------------------
$ chmod a-w /var/log/radius/radacct/detail1
----------------------------------------------------

Send the server another accounting packet ( `bob-acct-stop.sh`).

Verify that the client receives an accounting response packet, that
the `detail1` module fails, and that the server is using the `detail2`
module to log the request.

Verify that the `detail1` file does not contain the accounting request
by examining it:

[source, bash]
-----------------------------------------------
$ more /var/log/radius/radacct/detail1
-----------------------------------------------

Verify that the `detail2` file exists, and that it contains the accounting
request:

[source, bash]
-----------------------------------------------
$ more /var/log/radius/radacct/detail2
-----------------------------------------------

== Questions

1.  Could the configuration for the "group" section containing the
"detail1" and "detail2" modules be simplified? If so, how?

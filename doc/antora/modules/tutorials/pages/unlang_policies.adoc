= Unlang Policies

*Goal:* Create and use policies for abstracting business logic

*Time:* 10-20 minutes

*File:*

- `etc/raddb/policy.d/*`

*`man` page:* unlang

include::partial$unlang_start.adoc[]

Look through the existing files in `etc/raddb/policy.d/*` and `man unlang`
to get a feel for the unlang syntax and the tasks that policies can
be used for.

The basic structure of a policy is the policy name then a set of curly
braces containing the body of the policy

------------------------------------------------
a_policy {
	if (&User-Name =~ /@([\w.+])/) {
		update reply {
			Reply-Message := "Hello remote %{User-Name}"
		}
	}
}
------------------------------------------------

Policies defined within `etc/raddb/policy.d/*` can be called from
anywhere in the server where modules can be called.

------------------------------------------------
authorize {
	...
	a_policy
	...
}
------------------------------------------------

Create a policy `proxy_to_realm` that forwards the incoming request
to to a remote realm if the `User-Name` attribute ends in `@<remote realm>`.

The contents of this policy should be identical to the the 'unlang'
code written for the xref:unlang_splitting_strings.adoc[Splitting Strings]
tutorial.

Call this policy at the start of the `authorize {}` section of the
`etc/raddb/sites-available/default` virtual server.

All the information you need to create this policy is contained within
`man unlang` pages and the examples in this exercise.

== Questions

1.  What are the advantages of using the policy language over interpreted
    language modules?
2.  What are the main differences between a policy and a function in other
    languages?

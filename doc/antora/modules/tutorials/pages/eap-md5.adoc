= Other protocols within RADIUS: EAP-MD5

*Goal:* To configure the server to use the EAP-MD5 authentication
protocol and to send and receive test packets.

*Time:* 10-15 minutes.

*File:*

- `etc/raddb/mods-available/eap`

*Diagram:*

*Programs*: radtest

For this exercise, your are assumed to have previously worked
through and be familiar with the exercise in xref:new_user.aodc[New User] for
user "bob".

While RADIUS is an authentication protocol in its own right, other
authentication protocols are also used in the network. One such protocol
is the Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP). It originally was
designed to be used in PPP, but has been more widely used in recent
deployments.

EAP is a protocol that is intended to carry other authentication
protocols. It does not carry authorization information like RADIUS, so it
therefore has a more limited application. One of the most common uses for
EAP is for wireless authentication. In this exercise, we will configure
and test the EAP-MD5 sub-type of EAP.

`raddb/mods-available/eap` has a configuration section for the `eap`
module. The EAP sub-types are configured inside of that section. By
default, the server ships with the EAP-MD5 module enabled, and with the
EAP module initiating EAP-MD5 for all RADIUS requests containing EAP.

You should now read the appropriate section of the `raddb/mods-available/eap`
file, to verify that the `eap` module is configured and that the `md5`
sub-module of the `eap` module is configured.

The sample packet `eap-md5.sh` may now be used to test EAP-MD5
authentication. The server output should be examined to follow the
EAP-MD5 authentication process, and that output should be compared to the
schematic diagram

== Questions

1.  In which of the following sections is the `eap` module used?
authorize, authenticate, and accounting.
2.  Which of those sections do not reference the `eap`
module? Why?
3.  What is the difference (if any) between the server output for this
test and the diagram below? Why is there a difference?

4.  Why do we test EAP-MD5 before testing other EAP types?
5.  How is the EAP protocol carried within a RADIUS packet?
6.  Why is the Message-Authenticator attribute required when using EAP?
7.  What security issues exist with EAP-MD5?
8.  Why is EAP-MD5 disabled in newer operating systems?

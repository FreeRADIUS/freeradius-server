= Further dynamic translation

*Goal:* To use dynamic translation of strings to perform inter-module
references.

*Time:* 20-35 minutes.

*Files:*

- `etc/raddb/radiusd.conf`
- `etc/raddb/users`

Run-time variables in the server may include more than simple references to
attributes in packets. The server supports the ability to perform complex
inter-module queries, which significantly extends its usefulness. In this
exercise, we will work through a number of different examples of configuring
inter-module calls.

To start, open `raddb/mods-available/exec` and read the sample configuration for
the `exec` module. Then, edit the users file to add the following entry at the
top:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
bob Password.Cleartext := "hello"
    Callback-Id = "%(exec:/bin/echo Hello, there)"
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The `echo` program may be in `/usr/bin/echo`, depending on your local system. On
many systems you can use the following command:

[source, bash]
------------
$ which echo
------------

This will tell you the full pathname of the `echo` command. Use that pathname in
the file entry.

Start the server and send it a test packet for user `bob`. The debug output of
the server should print messages similar to the following.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(0)  files : users: Matched entry bob at line 1
Executing: /bin/echo Hello, there:
Program returned code (0) and output 'Hello, there'
(0)  files : EXPAND %(exec:/bin/echo Hello, there)
(0)  files :    --> Hello, there
(0)   [files] = ok
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

These message indicate that the first entry in the file (at line 1) was used to
match the incoming request.

The `exec` xlat function was then used to perform the dynamic translation of the
string, which resulted in a call to the `rlm_exec` module.

That module called the `Exec-Program` function of the server to execute a
program, and finally, the `exec` xlat function returned the string "Hello
there".

That text was then sent back to the RADIUS client in the `Callback-Id`
attribute, which was not quoted above.

Another dynamic translation string function is the `expr` module. It performs
some simple mathematical operations. The following sample file entry
demonstrates how to use the `expr` module.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
bob	Password.Cleartext := "hello"
	Session-Timeout = `%{expr: 60 * 60}`
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Dynamically translated strings may also be used as "check items" to match
requests coming in to the server. The following examples show how those strings
(or run-time variables) may be used to both match a request and to configure
dynamic responses.

You should use the `bob-login-one.sh` script to send a request to match the
first entry and should send another request with a different NAS-Port.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
bob	Password.Cleartext := "hello", NAS-Port == "%(exec:/usr/bin/id -u)"
	Reply-Message = "Your port is very nice.",
	Session-Timeout = "%{expr: 60 * 60}"

bob	Password.Cleartext := "hello", NAS-Port != "%(exec:/usr/bin/id -u)"
        Reply-Message = "Your port is less nice.",
        Session-Timeout = "%{expr: 60 * 2}"
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The run-time variables may be nested, too. The following file entry
demonstrates this nesting.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
bob	Password.Cleartext := "hello"
	Session-Timeout = "%{expr: 60 * %(exec:/usr/bin/id -u})"
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In this case, the user "bob" is given one minute of access time,
multiplied by the value of the "UID" of the RADIUS server.

== Further considerations

Run-time variables allow inter-module calling. The administator may perform LDAP
queries and SQL queries to use database information in other modules.

Unfortunately, the format of the string is module-dependent. This limitation
comes from the fact that each module has its own syntax for database queries.
The syntax for querying LDAP databases is different than the syntax for querying
SQL database. The administrator should consult the `man` pages for the relevant
module for more information on the syntax for run-time dynamic translation of
strings.

Another limitation is that the query string can be only approximately 250
characters long in the current version of the server. This limitation may be
removed in a later version.

== Questions

1.  How would you perform an SQL query in a run-time variable, instead of
executing a program?
2.  Why is it useful for modules to be able to query information from other
modules?
3.  What is an example of conditional syntax for a run-time variable?

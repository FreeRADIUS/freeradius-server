= EAP-PEAP: Tunneled Authentication

*Goal:* Configure the FreeRADIUS server to authenticate users using EAP-PEAP, then verify it works by sending and receiving test packets.

*Time:* 20–35 minutes.

*Files:*

- `mods-available/eap` — controls which EAP methods are enabled
- `mods-config/files/authorize` — the flat file where test users like `bob` are defined
- `sites-available/inner-tunnel` — the virtual server that handles Phase 2 authentication and looks up the user
- `eapol_test/peap-mschapv2.conf` — configuration for the test client

== What is EAP-PEAP?

EAP-PEAP protects user credentials by wrapping the login exchange inside an encrypted TLS tunnel. Think of it like sending a letter inside a locked box — even if someone intercepts it, they cannot read what is inside.

** *Phase 1* — The server presents its TLS certificate and a secure encrypted tunnel is created between the client and the server. At this point, only the anonymous identity (e.g. `anonymous@example.org`) is visible on the network. The real username is hidden.
** *Phase 2* — Inside that tunnel, the client sends the real username and password using EAP-MSCHAPv2. The server then looks up the user in its user database, checks the password, and either accepts or rejects the request.

The main advantage over EAP-TLS is that the *client does not need a certificate* — only the server does. This makes deployment much simpler in large environments.

Start the server, and verify that the `peap` module was loaded and that
the server is `Ready to process requests`.

This exercise does not cover how to configure EAP-PEAP on the wireless
client nor how to set up a wireless access point to perform EAP-PEAP.
We suggest that you consults the documentation for your
wireless client software for details on this process.

For the initial testing of EAP-PEAP, we recommend using
`EAP-MSCHAPv2` on the wireless client as the tunneled authentication
protocol. You should check that the `mschap` module is configured in the
`modules` directory. The `mschapv2` module performs EAP-MSCHAPv2
authentication and is contained in the `eap` section of the
`eap.conf`. While these authentication methods are similar, they
are not identical. Both modules need to be configured for EAP-PEAP to
work.

Test PEAP ``inner tunnel'' authentication via the following command:

[source, bash]
--------------------------------------------------------------
$ radtest -t mschap 127.0.0.1:18120 USER PASSWORD 0 testing123
--------------------------------------------------------------

Once the wireless client has been configured to enable EAP-PEAP,
you should perform a test authentication to the server. If all goes well,
the server, AP, and wireless client should exchange multiple RADIUS
`Access-Request` and `Access-Challenge` packets. This process should take
a few seconds, and you should wait until it is done. If all goes well,
the final packet from the server should be an `Access-Accept` and should
contain the `MS-MPPE-Recv-Key` and `MS-MPPE-Send-Key` attributes.

Verify that the authentication succeeded by using the `ping` command to
see if the wireless client now has network access.

== Further Considerations

Different wireless clients may implement different tunneled
authentication protocols inside of EAP-PEAP. These clients may not be
compatible with all RADIUS servers. FreeRADIUS has only been tested
using EAP-MSCHAPv2 as the tunneled authentication protocol. Other
protocols may require source code changes to work.

If there are issues getting EAP-PEAP to work on Windows, the following
registry setting may be useful

------------------------------------------------------------------
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Tracing\RASTLS\EnableTracing
------------------------------------------------------------------

Set the above key to value ``1''. A file `RASTLS.LOG` will be created
and will contain the requested tracing information.

== Questions

1.  How does EAP-PEAP compare with EAP-TTLS?
2.  What authentication protocols may be carried inside of the TLS
tunnel for EAP-PEAP?
3.  Would you use EAP-PEAP in a large deployment? If so, why? If not,
why not?

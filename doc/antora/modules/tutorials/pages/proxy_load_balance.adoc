= Proxy Load Balancing

*Goal:* To configure a server to load-balanceproxied requests across
multiple home servers.

*Time:* 10-15 minutes

*File:*

- `etc/raddb/proxy.conf`

*Diagram:*

For this exercise, the users will be divided into the same groups as
the previous exercise in xref:proxy_failover.adoc[Proxy Failover].

User 1 will edit his `proxy.conf` file, so that the entries for
"realm2" are marked as load balancing. The users will send multiple
requests to the server for "realm1", and observe how the proxied
requests are distributed among the servers for "realm2".

== Questions

1.  Why is load balancing useful?
2.  How is load balancing different than fail-over?
3.  What happens to the load balancing when one of the "realm2"
servers is stopped, and the server for "realm1" tries to proxy
requests to it?
4.  How would this exercise be different if there were more than two
home server to load balance to?
5.  If the load balancing home server which has "failed" is started
again, will the proxying server ever send requests to it again? If so,
when? If not, why not?

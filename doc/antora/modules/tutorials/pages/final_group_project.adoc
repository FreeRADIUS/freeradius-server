= Group Project - Simulating a production service

*Goal:* To create a simulated, federated, production service

*Time:* 2-3 hours

This task is split into multiple sections.  If working with an instructor
you should ask for your configuration file to be validated by the instructor
after each section is complete.

For this task you will need at least two participants.

== Preparation

Each participant should decide on the following:

* A realm e.g. example.com, that their RADIUS server will respond to request for
  the realm must be unique within the group.  This will be referred to as
  `your_realm` in the rest of the text.
* A shared secret for the realm `your_secret`.
* A backend module (`your_module`) to use to authenticate their users. Again,
  this should be unique within the group.
  Options are:
** `files`
** `ldap`
** `redis`
** `rest`
** `sql`
  For everything except `files` it's recommended to pick a module where you're
  familiar with the backend protocol.
* A set of credentials (`your_user`, `your_password`). These should not be
  sensitive credentials as they will be seen by the rest of the group.

Each user should send the following information to the instructor or place it in
a shared document:

- `your_realm`
- `your_secret`
- `your_ip` (the public IP address of your test machine)
- `your_module`
- `your_user`
- `your_password`

For local preparation, you should ensure that the following sections have no
content:

- The `recv Access-Request { ... }` or `authorize { ... }` section of
  `/etc/raddb/sites-available/default`.
- The `send Access-Accept { ... }` or `post-auth { ... }` section of
  `/etc/raddb/sites-available/default`.
  _Clear the `post-auth-type reject { ...}` section if present but do not remove_.
- The `send Access-Reject { ... }` section of `/etc/raddb/sites-available/default`.

After completing each of the sections below, you should check that the
configuration you've produced is valid (radiusd -XC), and if possible, test the
functionality you've configured using `radtest` or `radclient`/

== Proxying

*Goal:* To simulate federated access, by configuring proxy destinations for
multiple upstream home servers.

*Files:*

- `etc/raddb/proxy.conf`
- `etc/raddb/sites-available/default` (optionally)
- xref:raddb/mods-available/linelog.adoc[`etc/raddb/mods-available/linelog`] (optionally)

*Time:* 20-30 minutes

For each participant in the group, create a realm with a single home server.

The information for the realm should come from the shared document, and should use
the realm name, the secret, and the ip address supplied by the participant.

For `your_realm`, you should create a realm which authenticates users locally on
your server.

Liveliness checks should be performed with 'status-server'.

All remote realms should be configured with "nostrip", so the full username is
proxied.

The local realm should not have "nostrip" set.

=== Bonus tasks

* When proxied requests fail, create a linelog message containing the date, the
  username and the destination realm.
* Log all outbound packets to the proxy.
* Log all inbound packets from the proxy.
* For each home server
** Set the check interval to three seconds.
** Set the check timeout to three seconds.
** Set the "number of answers until alive" to three answers.

== Clients

*Goal:* Allow incoming requests from other servers.

*Files:*

- `etc/raddb/clients.conf`

*Time*: 15-20 minutes

Add client entries for each of the other participants server's, using
the participant's name as the client name, the ip of their server as `ipaddr` and
`your_secret` as the secret.

[WARNING]
====
The secret used for the client _must_ be _your_ secret, not the other participants
secret.  The other participant will be configuring your secret in the home
server definition to send requests to your home server.  The client and home server
definitions must match.
====

== Loading credentials

*Goal:* Setup the backend, and populate it with credentials.

*Time:* 10-60 minutes

For your chosen backend:

- Install any necessary packages
- Load any FreeRADIUS specific schemas

After the backend has bee setup insert your own credentials, and those for every
other participant in the group, into your backend datastore.

If the datastore provides no authentication method (`sql`, `redis`), you should
use the value of `&Stripped-User-Name` as the key, and when the user attempts to
login, retrieve the user's password and store it in
`&control.Password.Cleartext`.

== Authorization

*Goal:* Retrieve user information from a backend datastore.

*Files:*

- xref:raddb:mods-available/suffix.adoc[`etc/raddb/mods-available/suffix`]
- xref:raddb:mods-available/files.adoc[`etc/raddb/mods-available/files`]
- `etc/raddb/users`
- xref:raddb:mods-available/ldap.adoc[`etc/raddb/mods-available/ldap`]
- xref:raddb:mods-available/rest.adoc[`etc/raddb/mods-available/redis`]
- xref:raddb:mods-available/rest.adoc[`etc/raddb/mods-available/rest`]
- xref:raddb:mods-available/sql.adoc[`etc/raddb/mods-available/sql`]

*Time:* 20-60 minutes

First, in the `recv Access-Request { ... }` or `authorize { ... }` section of
of an appropriate virtual server,  call the suffix module.

If, after the suffix module has returned, the `&control.Proxy-To-Realm` attribute
is set, use the `return` keyword to exit from the section.  This prevents local
modules being called, when we know the request will be handled by a remote proxy.

[source,unlang]
----
suffix
if (&control.Proxy-To-Realm) {
	return
}
----

The following backend modules have an built in authorization method:

- `files`
- `ldap`
- `rest`
- `sql`

The redis module has a string expansion %{redis:<command>} which can be used
to retrieve a single value from the datastore.

Call the backend module's authorize method (or run an appropriate expansion) to
determine if the authenticating user exists in the datastore.

If the user does exist, and your module has an authenticate method (`ldap`,
`rest`), set `&control.Auth-Type` to an appropriate value.

If the backend module does not have an authenticate method (`redis`, `files`,
`sql`), you should ensure the "known good" copy of the user's password is set in
`&control.Password.Cleartext` and then call the pap module.

=== Bonus tasks

- If the user was `notfound`, i.e. the user is local, log the fact the user was
not found, along with the username, date and client IP address.

== Authentication

*Goal:* Authenticate a user.

*Time:* 20-30 minutes

For `ldap` and `rest` add or uncomment an appropriate `Auth-Type` section.

For other backend modules, ensure the PAP module's `Auth-Type` section is
uncommented.

Run `radtest` or `radclient`, with credentials:
`<your_user>@<your_realm>` and `your_password`. You should receive an Access-Accept.

=== Bonus tasks

- If the user was accepted, log the date, username, and client ip address.
- If the user was rejected, log the date, username, and client ip address.

== Remote-Authentication

*Goal:* Verify all participants have configured their RADIUS services correctly.

*Time:* 20+ minutes

Check with the other participants to see how much of the exercise they have
completed.  If a participant has a working RADIUS server, send request
with `<your_user>@<their_realm>` and `your_password`, and verify that
their server responds with an Access-Accept.

If their server does not respond with an Access-Accept, work with the other
participant to debug the issue.

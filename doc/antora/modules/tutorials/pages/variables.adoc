= Using configuration and run-time variables

*Goal:* To use run-time variable expansion.

*Time:* 15-30 minutes.

*Files:*

- `etc/raddb/radiusd.conf`
- `etc/raddb/users`
- `etc/raddb/mods-available/detail`

*`man` page:* `radiusd.conf`

*documentation page:* xref:reference:unlang/xlat/index.adoc[String expansions]

There are two kinds of variables within the server. The first is within
`radiusd.conf` and related files. These variables are referenced via the
`$` character, which is used to define common terms (e.g. `${logdir}` so that
those terms do not have to be repeated multiple times in the
configuration files. These variables are used only when the server reads
the configuration files, and they cannot be updated or edited once the files
have been read.

The second kind of variable is a run-time variable, which is dynamically
expanded for each request received by the server. These variables are
referenced by the `%` character, and they may be used to pull the values of
attributes from the request to be used by a module. These variables may
also be used by one module to obtain information from another module.

In this exercise, we cover configuration variables and some simple
properties of the run-time variables. Later exercises cover additional
properties of the run-time variables.

The main configuration file `radiusd.conf` and the module configuration
files contains a number of examples of the use of variables. For example,
the `detail` module (configured in `etc/raddb/mods-enabled/detail`)
has a configuration entry named "filename", which by default has the
following value:

----------------------------------------------------------------
filename = ${radacctdir}/%{Client-IP-Address}/detail-%Y%m%d
----------------------------------------------------------------

The configuration entry is composed of two kinds of variable expansion.
One references the `${radacctdir}` configuration variable, which was
previously defined in `radiusd.conf`. The following variables are
expanded at run time and depend on information in the request packet
and other dynamically calculated data.

Start the server in debugging mode (`radiusd -X`).
In the server output, look for the `detail` module and the `filename`
configuration entry for that module. Verify that the string printed
for the `filename` does not print the reference to the `${radacctdir}`
variable, but instead has substituted the value of that variable.
Verify also that the values of the run-time variables have _not_
been substituted and that they are still printed as variables.

If you don't see any configuration printed for the `detail` file module
ensure it is uncommented in the `accounting {}` section of the
`raddb/sites-available/default` virtual server.

Now read the
https://github.com/FreeRADIUS/freeradius-server/blob/v3.0.x/doc/configuration/variables.rst[variables]
documentation file to determine the meaning of the variables used in the `filename` configuration entry.
Once you are done, send the server an accounting packet (e.g.,
`bob-acct-stop.sh`), and go look for the detail file, which will be
dynamically created. Verify that the contents of the file are the
accounting packet you just sent.

In addition to being used in the configuration files, run-time variables
may also be used to create values for reply attributes. Stop the server,
and edit the users file to add the following entry at the top:

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
bob Password.Cleartext := "hello"
        Reply-Message = "Hello %{User-Name}, your NAS port is %{NAS-Port}",
        Reply-Message += "at time %T"
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Start the server, and run the `bob-login-one.sh` script. Verify that the
`Reply-Message` attributes contain the user name, NAS port, time, and a
copy of the `Class` attribute from the reply.

== Questions

1.  Why are run-time variables useful?
2.  How would you configure that entry in the file to reply with the
directory name where the `radiusd.conf` file is stored? Why is this a
bad idea?
3.  How would you create an entry in the users file that matched users when
their `Class` was the same as their `NAS-Port`?

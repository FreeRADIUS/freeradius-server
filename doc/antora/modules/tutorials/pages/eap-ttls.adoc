= EAP-TTLS: Tunneled authentication

*Goal:* To configure the server to use the EAP-TTLS authentication
protocol and to send and receive test packets.

*Time:* 20-35 minutes.

*File:*

- `etc/raddb/sites-available/default`

*Diagram:*

During installation the build system automatically creates
certificates for use with TTLS. In a normal installation, there should
be little or no action required to enable TTLS.

This exercise does not cover how to configure EAP-TTLS on the wireless
client nor how to set up a wireless access point to perform EAP-TTLS.
We suggest that you consult the documentation for your wireless
client software for details on this process.

For the initial testing of EAP-TTLS, we recommend using `PAP` on the
wireless client as the tunneled authentication protocol.

Once the wireless client has been configured to enable EAP-TTLS,
you should perform a test authentication to the server. If all goes well,
the server, AP, and wireless client should exchange multiple RADIUS
`Access-Request` and `Access-Challenge` packets. This process should take
a few seconds, and you should wait until it is done. If all goes well,
the final packet from the server should be an `Access-Accept` and should
contain the `MS-MPPE-Recv-Key` and `MS-MPPE-Send-Key` attributes.

Verify that the authentication succeeded by using the `ping` command to
see if the wireless client now has network access.

== Questions

1.  How is EAP-TTLS easier to use than EAP-TLS?
2.  What authentication protocols may be carried inside of the TLS
tunnel for EAP-TTLS?
3.  Would you use EAP-TTLS in a large deployment? If so, why? If not,
why not?

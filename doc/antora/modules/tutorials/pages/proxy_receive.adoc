= Configuring a server to send and receive proxy requests

*Goal:* To configure the server to proxy packets to a remote (home)
RADIUS server and to receive packets from another proxy server.

*Time:* 15-25 minutes

*Files:*

- `etc/raddb/proxy.conf`
- `etc/raddb/clients.conf`

For this exercise, the users will be divided into groups of two. One
user will be named "realm1" and the other will be named
"realm2".

Each user will configure two realms in the `proxy.conf` file. One of the
user's assigned realms will be authenticated by the local RADIUS
server. The other realm will be proxied to the RADIUS server
administered by the other user. Both realms will be configured to
"strip" the realm name from the incoming request.

User 1:

realm1 is local

realm2 gets proxied to the server running as "realm2".

User 2:

realm1 gets proxied to the server running as "realm1".

realm2 is local

The users should also configure each other's server as a RADIUS
client, as given in the exercise in xref:new_client.adoc[New Clients].

The entry from the exercise in xref:new_user.adoc[New User] for user "bob" in
the file, will be used in this exercise.

The example packets `bob.sh`, `bob@realm1.sh`, and `bob@realm2.sh` may
be used in this exercise.

Each user should test that authentication requests from "bob" to
their RADIUS server should result in authentication accept replies and
that the request was not forwarded to the other RADIUS server.

Each user should test that authentication requests for their own
realm (User 1: "bob@realm1", User 2: "bob@realm2") to their
RADIUS server should result in authentication accept replies and that
the request was not forwarded to the other RADIUS server.

Each user in turn should then attempt authentication using the other
user's realm (User 1: "bob@realm2", User 2: "bob@realm1"),
to their local RADIUS server.

Each in turn should verify that authentication requests for their
realm sent to the other user's RADIUS server results in an
authentication reject.

User 2 should then stop his server. User 1 should then attempt an
authentication request to his server where the request would normally
be proxied. Both users should examine the debug logs of User 1â€™s
RADIUS client and server in order to observe what the server's resulting behavior
will be.

== Questions

1.  Why is it necessary for each server to mark some realms as local?
2.  What would happen if each user did not configure the other RADIUS
server in the "raddb/clients.conf" file?
3.  What would happen if each user did not configure the realms to
"strip" the realm from the proxied requests?

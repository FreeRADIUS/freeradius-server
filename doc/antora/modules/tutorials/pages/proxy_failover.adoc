= Proxy Fail-over

*Goal:* To configure a "backup" home server that is used when the
"primary" home server fails.

*Time:* 15-25 minutes

*Files:*

- `etc/raddb/proxy.conf`
- `etc/raddb/clients.conf`

*Diagram:*

For this exercise, you should find a group of other willing
FreeRADIUS users!

Divide yourselves into groups of three. One person (user 1) will
operate the RADIUS server for "realm1" and the others will be operate
the RADIUS server for "realm2".

Each user will configure their realm in the `proxy.conf` file to
be a "local" realm. user 1 will also configure two entries in the
`proxy.conf` file for "realm2", one entry for each of the other
partner's RADIUS servers. user 1 will configure the realms to "strip"
the realm name from the incoming request.

The two group for "realm2" should also configure their
`clients.conf` file to permit user 1â€™s RADIUS server to act as a client,
as given in the exercise in xref:new_client.adoc[New Clients].
Each user operating "realm2" should pick a different shared
secret to use with user 1.

Once the servers have been configured, the group should collectively
observe user 1 sending the following requests to their server:
- bob@realm1.sh
- bob@realm2.sh

The group should verify that the expected authentication requests
sent to the server for "realm1" are handled locally, as in the
exercise in xref:proxy.adoc[Proxy].

The group should then verify that the expected requests sent to
the server for "realm1" are proxied to a server for "realm2". The
group should send multiple requests to the server for "realm1" that are
proxied to a server for "realm2", and they should verify that all of
the requests are proxied to the same home server for "realm2".

The group should then stop the "realm2" server that responded
to that request, and they should repeat the request to "realm1". The
group should observe the resulting behavior of the server for "realm1".

If time permits, the group may switch roles, so that users have the
opportunity to set up a proxy and a home server.

== Questions

1.  Which server for "realm2" is picked by "realm1"? Why?
2.  Would the server for "realm1" ever again try to send packets to
the "realm2" server that has been stopped? If so, when? If not,
why not?
3.  What would happen if both servers for "realm2" failed?

= Adding a new client to the server

*Goal:* To permit an additional RADIUS client to communicate with the
server.

*Time:* 5-10 minutes.

*File:*

- `etc/raddb/clients.conf`

The RADIUS server will only communicate with known clients. This
restriction is for security, so that unknown machines on the Internet
cannot probe the RADIUS server with test packets.

In FreeRADIUS, the `clients.conf` file lists the clients that are
permitted to send requests to the server. Take some time to read this file and
the included comments.

Configure the server with the the IP address of the new client and a
shared secret. If the server is already running, stop it.

Start the server

[source, bash]
------------
$ radiusd -X
------------

Send a Status-Server packet from the new client to the server, using the
correct IP address, port, and shared secret.

Verify that the server saw the packet. Also verify that the client saw
the response.

Some common problems are:

* not using the correct port in the client software
* not using the the correct shared secret in the client software
* the server responds to the client from an address that is different from the one to which the client sent the request.

The first two problems can be solved by configuring the client with the
correct information. The last problem is seen when the client does not
see the response from the server, or when the server gives an error message about an
invalid response.

If the server responds to the packet and the client accepts the
response, then the test was successful, and the server may be halted.

== Questions

1.  What happens when the server receives a packet from a machine not
listed in "clients.conf"?
2.  Why does the client not accept the response from the server when
that response originates from another IP address?
3.  Why does the server have to be re-started when the "clients.conf"
file is edited?
4.  What are the other fields in a client entry, and what are they used
for?

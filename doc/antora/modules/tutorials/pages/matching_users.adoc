= Matching entries in the users file

*Goal:* To configure multiple entries for a user in the "users" file
and to validate the server's configuration by sending test packets to
exercise the new entries.

*Time:* 30-45 minutes.

Now that we have verified that we can add a simple entry to the file, we
will try more complex configurations.

In this exercise, we will add three configuration entries for a user
named "bob" with clear-text password "hello". The three entries are
related as follows:

* The first will configure user "bob" with password "hello". It will
configure a reply message in an appropriate attribute. This
configuration entry will cause the server to continue processing the
file.
* The second entry will configure user "bob" and will match only when
"bob" is asking to use PPP. The configuration entry should add the
appropriate attributes to the reply, to allow "bob" to use PPP and to
assign him the IP address 192.168.10.12. This entry should also cause
the server to continue processing the file.
* The last entry will configure any user asking for "framed" service,
and will assign them a default route of 192.168.10.1 with netmask of
255.255.255.0.

We suggest that you approach the problem by configuring each of the
three entries in isolation. That is, add one entry, then create and send test
packets until the server responds with the attributes you expect. Then,
comment out the first entry and repeat the process for the second
entry. Do the same for the third entry. Once all entries work in
isolation, uncomment the first two and verify that the combination of
entries behaves as expected.

Test the server with username "bob" and password "hello". Use the
debug output of the server to see which entries in the file were
matched. You may use `radclient` or the `bob.sh` script to send the
packets. In that case, save the packets into a file, and use the "-f"
parameter to radclient to tell it which file to read.

Perform other authentication tests, adding the appropriate attributes to
the request sent by the RADIUS client. Continue until you have packets
that will match:

* entries 1 and 2, but not 3.
* entries 1 and 3, but not 2.
* entries 1, 2, and 3.

Save copies of the packets.

== Questions

1.  What is the difference between the Framed-Route and Framed-Routing
Attributes?
2.  What is the Framed-IP-Netmask attribute used for?
3.  What are potential pitfalls with the entry 2? That is, the entry
meets the requirements, but do the requirements fit the needs of the
network?
4.  How does this kind of simple configuration scale to many users?

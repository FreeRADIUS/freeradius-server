= Bugs

== Introduction

The FreeRADIUS web site is at https://www.freeradius.org, and most
information referenced in this document can be found there.

This is primarily for non-developers of the FreeRADIUS server. If you
are able to patch the code to work correctly, then we invite you to join
the development list to discuss it. If you’re the type who know little
about how to code, then this is the place for you!

== You found a bug

Where the server terminates ungracefully due to a bus error,
segmentation violation, or other memory error, you should create a new
issue in the issue tracker https://bugs.freeradius.org, including
information from the debugging sections below.

For other issues, you should first discuss them on the users list, to
see if anyone can reproduce them. Often there’s a simple explanation of
why the server behaves as it does, and it’s not necessarily a bug in the
code, so browse the lists’ archives of the last two months, and if you
don’t see messages about it, ask!

If the behavior is correct but confusing, we think that’s a bug too, and
you should file a bug against our documentation.

For more information about the users list, the lists’ archives and the
faq, please visit https://www.freeradius.org/list/users.html Please make
sure to READ and RESPECT the house-rules. You will get much better
response and much faster if you do!

== Core dumps

If the server, or one of the accompanying programs core dumps, then you
should rebuild the server as follows:

```
$ ./configure --enable-developer
$ make
$ make install
```

and then run the program again. You may have to to enable core dumps,
via:

```
$ ulimit -c unlimited
```

When it core dumps, do:

```
$ gdb /path/to/executable /path/to/core/file
```

Enable logging in `gdb` via the following commands:

```
(gdb) set logging file gdb-radiusd.log
(gdb) set logging on
```

and follow the instructions in the proceeding section.

You can also enable the ``panic_action'' given in
`raddb/radiusd.conf`. See the comments in that file for more details
about automatically collecting gdb debugging information when the server
crashes.

== Debugging a live server

If you can’t get a core dump, or the problem doesn’t result in a core
dump, you may have to run the server under gdb. To do this, ensure that
you have symbols in the binaries (i.e. a non-stripped binary) by
re-building the server as described in the previous section. Then, run
the server under gdb as follows:

```
$ gdb radiusd
```

Enable logging in `gdb` via the following commands:

```
(gdb) set logging file gdb-radiusd.log
(gdb) set logging on
```

Tell `gdb` to pass any necessary command-line arguments to the server:

```
(gdb) set args ...
```

Where the ``…'' are the command-line arguments you normally pass to
radiusd. For debugging, you probably want to do:

```
(gdb) set args -fxx
```

Then, do:

```
(gdb) run
```

When something interesting happens, you can hit CTRL-C in the window,
and you should be back at the gdb prompt:

```
(gdb)
```

And follow the instructions in the next section.

== Obtaining useful information

Once you have a core dump loaded into gdb, or FreeRADIUS running under
gdb, you may use the commands below to get useful information about the
state of the server.

If the server was built with threads, you can do:

```
(gdb) info threads
```

Which will give you information about the threads. If the server isn’t
threaded, that command-line will print a message saying so.

Then, do:

```
(gdb) thread apply all bt full
```

If the server isn’t threaded, the ``thread apply'' section isn’t
necessary

The output should be printed to the screen, and also sent to the
gdb-radiusd.log file.

You should then submit the information from the log file, along with any
server output, the output of `radiusd -xv`, and information about your
operating system to:

https://bugs.freeradius.org/

Submitting it to the bug database ensures that the bug report won’t get
forgotten, and that it will be dealt with in due course.

You should provide the issue number in any mail sent to the user’s list.

== Valgrind

On Linux systems, `valgrind` is a useful tool that can catch certain
classes of bugs. To use it, run the server via:

```
$ valgrind --tool=memcheck --leak-check=full radiusd -Xm
```

It will print out certain kinds of errors to the screen. There may be a
number of errors related to OpenSSL, dlopen(), or libtldl. We cannot do
anything about those problems. However, any errors that are inside of
the FreeRADIUS source should be brought to our attention.

== Running with `screen`

If the bug is a crash of the server, and it takes a long time for the
crash to happen, perform the following steps:

* Log in as root.
* Open a screen session (https://www.gnu.org/software/screen/)
`$ screen bash`.
* Make sure FreeRADIUS is not running.
* Make sure you have all the debug symbols about, or a debugable version
of the server installed (one built with `--enable developer`).
* Configure screen to log to a file; Ctrl+a,h
* Type `gdb /path/to/radius` (or /path/to/freeradius on Debian).
* At the `(gdb)` prompt, type `run -X`.
* Detach from screen Ctrl+a,d.
* When you notice FreeRADIUS has died, reconnect to your screen session
`$ screen -D -r`.
* At the `(gdb)` prompt type `where` or for _lots_ of info try
`thread apply all bt full`.
* Tell screen to stop logging, Ctrl+a,h.
* Logout from screen.

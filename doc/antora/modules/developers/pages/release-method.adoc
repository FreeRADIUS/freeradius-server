= Release Method

== Topics

[arabic]
. As of 2.0, the release process is much simpler. Edit the Changelog
with the version number and any last updates.

```
# vi doc/ChangeLog
# git commit doc/ChangeLog
```

[arabic, start=2]
. Change version numbers in the VERSION file:

```
# vi VERSION
# git commit VERSION
```

[arabic, start=3]
. Make the files

NOTE: It also does `make dist-check`, which checks the build rules for
various packages.

```
# make dist
```

[arabic, start=4]
. Validate that the packages are OK. If so, tag the release.

NOTE: This does NOT actually do the tagging! You will have to run the
command it prints out yourself.

```
# make dist-tag
```

[arabic, start=5]
. Sign the packages. You will need the correct GPG key for this to work.

```
# make dist-sign
```

[arabic, start=6]
. Push to the FTP site. You will need write access to the FTP site for
this to work.

```
# make dist-publish
```

= Valgrind

On Linux systems, `valgrind` is a useful tool that can catch certain
classes of bugs. To use it, run the server via:

```
$ valgrind --tool=memcheck --leak-check=full radiusd -Xm
```

It will print out certain kinds of errors to the screen. There may be a
number of errors related to OpenSSL, dlopen(), or libtldl. We cannot do
anything about those problems. However, any errors that are inside of
the FreeRADIUS source should be brought to our attention.

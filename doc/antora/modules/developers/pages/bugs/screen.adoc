= Use `screen`

If the bug is a crash of the server, and it takes a long time for the
crash to happen, perform the following steps:

* Log in as root.
* Open a https://www.gnu.org/software/screen/[screen] session: `$ screen bash`.
* Make sure FreeRADIUS is not running.
* Make sure you have all the debug symbols about, or a debugable version
of the server installed (one built with `--enable-developer` as above).
* Configure screen to log to a file by pressing `Ctrl+a`, then `h`.
* Type `gdb /path/to/radiusd` (or /path/to/freeradius on Debian).
* At the `(gdb)` prompt, type `run -X`.
* Detach from screen with `Ctrl+a`, `d`.
* When you notice FreeRADIUS has died, reconnect to your screen session
`$ screen -D -r`.
* At the `(gdb)` prompt type `where` or for _lots_ of info try
`thread apply all bt full`.
* Tell screen to stop logging, `Ctrl+a`, `h`.
* Logout from screen.

= Core dumps

If the server (or one of the accompanying programs) core dumps, then you
should rebuild the server as follows:

```
$ ./configure --enable-developer
$ make
$ make install
```

and then run the program again. You may have to to enable core dumps,
via:

```
$ ulimit -c unlimited
```

When it core dumps, do:

```
$ gdb /path/to/executable /path/to/core/file
```

Enable logging in `gdb` via the following commands:

```
(gdb) set logging file gdb-radiusd.log
(gdb) set logging on
```

and follow the instructions in the xref:bugs/info.adoc[Extract Information]] section.

You can also enable the `panic_action` given in
`radiusd.conf`. See the comments in that file for more details
about automatically collecting gdb debugging information when the server
crashes.

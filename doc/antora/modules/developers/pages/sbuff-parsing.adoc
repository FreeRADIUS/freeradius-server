# Parsing with sbuffs

## Introduction

The aim of parsing is to convert a token stream into some internal format we can operate on easily.
The style of parsing used in FreeRADIUS is almost exclusively recursive descent parsing.

In recursive descent parsing functions are used to encapsulate grammar used for parsing a given token
(or sequence of tokens).  Each time we navigate to a deeper level in a syntax tree we call a parsing
function which represents the grammar for that level.  Whenever we find a terminal for that
grammar (or an obvious syntax error) we return up the call stack to allow the caller to determine
what to do.

Unfortunately, because we're working in C some conventions must be applied by the developer in order
to make parsing functions broadly compatible and callable from each other.

This document sets out standard function prototypes and conversions to ensure interoperability.

## Public functions

Unlike private parse functions public functions can be called anywhere from within the FreeRADIUS
code base.  Public functions **MUST** conform to the set of conventions below.

- On success the number of bytes must be returned.  If consuming no bytes is valid, `0` should
  be returned.
- On success the input `fr_sbuff_t` must be advanced by the number of bytes consumed.
- On error the input `fr_sbuff_t` **MUST NOT** be advanced.
- On error a negative integer representing the error location must be returned.
  This negative integer is indexed from 1 (not 0).
  For example a return value of `-5` with an input string `the lazy brown fox` indicates the error
  occurred at `l`.
- On success or error, any sbuff markers added to the input `fr_sbuff_t` must be released.
- The return type of the function should be `fr_slen_t`, this indicates that the function conforms
  to the above conventions.

The easiest way to ensure these conventions are met is to initialise a new `fr_sbuff_t` from the
input `fr_sbuff_t` as soon as the function is entered.

        /* our_in->start = in->p, our_in->p = in->p, our_in->end = in->end */
        fr_sbuff_t our_in = FR_SBUFF(in);

        /*
         *      Can't have an octo without a puss, are you crazy?!
         *
         *      Return the parse error as a negative integer and leave
         *      `in` unchanged.
         */
        if (!fr_sbuff_adv_past_str_literal(&our_in, "puss")) FR_SBUFF_RETURN_ERROR(&our_in); /* Returns -5 */

        /*
         *      Got an `octo` and a `puss`, inform the caller how
         *      much we consumed, and update `in`.
         */
        FR_SBUFF_RETURN_SET(in, &our_in); /* Returns 8 */
}

## Private functions

Private functions (static functions in the same source file) don't have the same requirements.
There's no reason for these functions to return the number of parsed bytes, and they can return `0`
for success, or `-1` for failure like other functions in the server.

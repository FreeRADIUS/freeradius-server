= Attribute Definitions

In FreeRADIUS v4, following the RFC definitions is critical. The modular codespace allows RADIUS to function as a plug-in protocol, like DHCP or DNS. Standardization enables devices from different manufacturers to communicate using shared protocols and frameworks. RFC-compliant systems show clear behaviours to prevent security issues in authentication or authorisation.

If non-standard attribute numbers or types are used, a NAS might ignore some authorisation instructions. FreeRADIUS v4 depends on the strict data types defined in https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8044[RFC 8044] ensure that attributes are parsed  the correct data type and interpreted accurately. This prevents "garbled" data or session crashes when dealing with complex attributes. Standard Logic: Many core modules depend on certain RFC attributes and formats. For example, State (RFC 5080) helps link many requests into one session. Re-defining these flows can lead to failed authentications or replay attacks.

RADIUS has a finite range (0–255) available for standard attributes. Defining a custom attribute with a number already used by an RFC can cause a collision. The server might apply the wrong policy to a packet. This can lead to unauthorised access or accounting errors. FreeRADIUS v4 supports Extended Attributes (IDs > 255). Ignoring RFC formats can break the server's ability to manage longer or fragmented attributes.

Use Internal Attributes (defined with the DEFINE keyword) for local logic. These attributes are never sent over the network, eliminating interoperability issues.

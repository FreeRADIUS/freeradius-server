= Module Interface

RLM Module Interface (for developers).

== Overview

FreeRADIUS is an authentication server. It does RADIUS authorization,
authentication, and accounting. It does NOT do database management, user
configuration updates, or email. All of those functions may be more
easily (and correctly) performed in programs outside of the server.

The only functionality performed by the server is:

* receive a RADIUS request
* process the request
* look up information one or more databases
* store information in one or more databases (proxying can be viewed
this way)
* respond to the request

There is no room, or need, for timers, listening on sockets, or anything
else in the server. Adding those functions to the server means that it
will become more complex, more unstable, more insecure, and more
difficult to maintain.

== Intent of the modules

The intent of modules is that they do small, simple, well-defined things
when RADIUS packets are received. If the module does things when RADIUS
packets are NOT received, then it has no business being in the server.
Similarly, the module infrastructure is NOT intended to allow servers,
applications, timed events, or anything other than handling incoming
RADIUS packets.

Modules perform an action when RADIUS packets are received. Modules
which do more (creating threads, forking programs) will NOT be added to
the server, and the server core will NOT be modified to enable these
kinds of modules. Those functions more properly belong in a separate
application.

Modules ARE permitted to open sockets to other network programs, and to
send and receive data on those sockets. Modules are NOT permitted to
open sockets, and to listen for requests. Only the server core has that
functionality, and it only listens for RADIUS requests.

== Module outline

The fundamental concepts of the rlm interface are module, instance, and
component.

A module is a chunk of code that knows how to deal with a particular
kind of database, or perhaps a collection of similar databases.

Examples:

[width="100%",cols="25%,75%",options="header",]
|===
| Module   | Description
| rlm_sql  | Contains code for talking to MySQL or Postgres, and for
             mapping RADIUS records onto SQL tables.
| rlm_unix | Contains code for making radiusd fit in well on unix-like
             systems, including getpw* authentication and utmp/wtmp-style
             logging.
|===

An instance specifies the actual location of a collection data that can
be used by a module. Examples:

* /var/log/radutmp
* the MySQL database on bigserver.theisp.com.example

A module can have multiple components which act on RADIUS requests at
different stages.  A module declares which components it supports by
putting function pointers in its `module_dl_t rlm_*` structure.

== Module configuration

The administrator requests the creation of a module instance by adding
it inside the `modules { ... }` block in radiusd.conf. The instance definition
looks like this::

```
module_name [instance_name] {
  param1 = value1
  param2 = value2
  param3 = value3
  ...
}
```

module_name:: The name used to load the module. To see the names of the
available modules, look for the `rlm_*.so` files in
`$installprefix/lib`.  The module_name is that, minus the `rlm_`
prefix and the `.so` suffix.

instance_name:: an identifier for distinguishing multiple instances of
the same module. If you are only loading a module once, you can leave
out the instance_name and it will be assumed to be the same as the
module_name.

The parameters inside the module block are passed without interpretation
to the module and generally point to the exact location of a database or
enable optional features of the module. Each module should document what
parameters it accepts and what they do.

For each `Access-Request` that comes to the server, the `recv
Access-Request { ... }` section is called. Then one of the
`authenticate <type> { ...  }` sections called, depending on the
`Auth-Type` attribute that was chosen by the previous section.`.

Finally, the `send Access-Accept { ... }` section is called, or
another one, depending on the reply packet type.

For each `Accounting-Request` that comes to the server, the `recv
Accounting-Request { ... } ` section is called, followed by the
`accounting <Acct-Status-Type> { ... } ` section.  Finally, the `send
Accounting-Response { ... }` section is called.

== The lifetime of a module

When the server is starting up, or reinitializing itself as a result of
a SIGHUP, it reads the `modules{}` section. Each configured module
will be loaded and its `init()` method will be called::

[source,c]
----
int init(void)
----

The `init()` method should take care of any setup that is not tied to
a specific instance. It will only be called once, even if there are
multiple instances configured.

For each configured instance, after the `init()` method, the
instantiate() method is called. It is given a handle to the
configuration block holding its parameters, which it can access with
cf_section_parse().

[source,c]
----
int instantiate(CONF_SECTION *cs, void **instance)
----

The `instantiate()` function should look up options in the config
section, and open whatever files or network connections are necessary
for the module to do its job. It also should create a structure holding
all of the persistent variables that are particular to this instance
(open file descriptors, configured pathnames, etc.) and store a pointer
to it in `*instance`. That `void *` becomes a handle (some would
call it a `cookie`) representing this instance. The instance handle is
passed as a parameter in all subsequent calls to the moduleâ€™s methods,
so they can determine which database they are supposed to act on.

The `authorize()`, `authenticate()`, `preaccounting()`, and
`accounting()` functions are all called the same way:

[source,c]
----
int authorize(void *instance, REQUEST *request)
int authenticate(void *instance, REQUEST *request)
int preaccounting(void *instance, REQUEST *request)
int accounting(void *instance, REQUEST *request)
----

they each receive the instance handle and the request, and are expected
to act on the request using the database pointed to by the instance
handle (which was set by the `instantiate()` function).

When the server is being shut down (as the first part of `SIGHUP` for
example) `detach()` is called for each module instance.

[source,c]
----
int detach(void *instance)
----

The `detach()` method should release whatever resources were allocated
by the `instantiate()` method.

After all instances are detached, the destroy() method is called.::

[source,c]
----
int destroy(void)
----

It should release resources that were acquired by the `init()` method.

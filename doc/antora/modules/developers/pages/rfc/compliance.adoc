= RFC Compliance

RFC compliance is critical for ensuring that production systems are
secure, interoperable, and scalable in modern environments.  Adhering
to the IETF standards provides a common language for diverse
networking hardware and software to communicate reliably.  The
importance of RADIUS RFC compliance centers on four key areas:

== Interoperability in Multi-Vendor Environments

* De Facto Standard: RADIUS is the industry standard for centralizing
  Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA). Compliance
  ensures that a RADIUS server can communicate with network access
  servers (NAS) like Wi-Fi access points, VPN gateways, and switches
  from different manufacturers (e.g., Cisco, Aruba, Fortinet).

* Consistent Behavior: RFCs provide documented, predictable behavior,
  reducing unexpected issues when integrating new equipment into an
  existing infrastructure.

* Standardized Attributes: Standards like
  https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2865[RFC 2865] and
  https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2868[RFC 2868] define how
  user attributes (e.g., VLAN assignments, tunnel protocols) are
  formatted, ensuring they are correctly interpreted across the
  network.

== Security and Vulnerability Mitigation

* Addressing Cryptographic Weaknesses: Legacy RADIUS (RFC 2865) relies
  on MD5 hashing, which is now considered insecure. Recent critical
  vulnerabilities like
  https://www.inkbridgenetworks.com/blastradius[BlastRADIUS]
  (identified in 2024) exploit these MD5 weaknesses to forge
  authentication responses.

* Protocol Evolution: Modern compliance often requires moving toward
  newer standards like RadSec (RADIUS over TLS, RFC 6614), which
  replaces unencrypted UDP transport with encrypted TLS. This protects
  sensitive data, such as usernames and location information, from
  eavesdropping and tampering.

* Mandatory Integrity Checks: Updated standards mandate features like
  the `Message-Authenticator` attribute to prevent packet forgery
  attacks that were previously optional.

== Scalability and Reliability

* Centralised Management: Compliance allows organizations to manage
  millions of users from a single point, making it suitable for large
  ISPs and global enterprises.

* Backward Compatibility: RFC-compliant systems are designed to evolve
  while maintaining connections with older infrastructure, allowing
  for gradual network upgrades without total system overhauls.

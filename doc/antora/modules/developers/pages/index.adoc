= FreeRADIUS Development

List with some usual howtos for FreeRADIUS.

Programming reference documentation can be found at the
https://doc.freeradius.org/[Doxygen] site.

# Instructions for Developers

As the name suggests, FreeRADIUS is developed under the GNU
General Public License, Version 2(GPLv2).
We invite anyone to use and contribute code to the project. The
following information should prove useful for potential
contributors.

## Patches and contributions

Development of FreeRADIUS is done using
Github. Please
submit issues, bugs, patches, etc. there. Additional instructions are on
the wiki.

## Development mailing list

We encourage everyone who might contribute code to join the FreeRADIUS
development list(http://www.freeradius.org/list/devel.html). This
list is highly technical and isn't for most users of the server.
For normal discussion of the server and how to use it, there's a
FreeRADIUS user-list.
You should *only* subscribe to the development list if you are
interested in writing software for the new server.


## Miscellaneous links

RADIUS RFC's and drafts: The two
most important are
RFC2865(http://www.freeradius.org/rfc/rfc2865.html) and
RFC2866.(http://www.freeradius.org/rfc/rfc2866.html). These are
the new RFCs, which replace the old ones,
RFC2138(http://www.freeradius.org/rfc/rfc2138.txt) and
RFC2139(http://www.freeradius.org/rfc/rfc2139.txt)

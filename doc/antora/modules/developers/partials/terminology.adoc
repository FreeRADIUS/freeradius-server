| freeradius, FreeRadius | freeRADIUS, FreeRADIUS                        | Use a standard word for freeRADIUS so users don't think it's a different software version or product. This form most represents our logo the most.

| Not Recommended        | Recommended Words             | Reason
| stupid, stupidities    | nonsensical, problems, issues, senseless (if referring to an action, not person.) Other suggestions - lower intelligence threshold, unwanted behaviors, unexpected results, imprudences. | Stupid is a superfluous word and not needed.

| retarded               | not recommended, nonsensical   | Use inclusive language, this word precludes 'slower than average' reader.
| hell                   | troublesome, gives you issues   | Hell is hard to translate and alternative words can be used.
| weenie                 | ineffectual, problematic, weak  | Weenie translates very differently into other languages and definitely not a good word to use.

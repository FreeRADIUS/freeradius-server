== Terminology

International English, or Global English, is the standard form of English used for global communication. Using global english prioritizes clarity and simplicity for non-native speakers in international contexts. Seamless communication between speakers from diverse linguistic backgrounds are possible.

To ensure effective communication, consider the following:

* Simplify language and avoid complex constructions.

* Write for translation, simpler words are easy to localize and understand.

* Use clear, short sentences and avoid ambiguous language.

* Try using standard expressions and avoid phrasal verbs, gerunds, and colloquialisms.

* Standardize dates, phone numbers, and addresses.

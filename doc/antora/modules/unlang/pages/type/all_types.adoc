= List of Data Types

The server support a wide range of data types, both in `unlang` and in
the dictionaries.  This page outlines the names and functionality of
those data types.

== Basic Data Types

There are a number of "basic" data types.  These data types are
fixed-size, and encapsulate simple concepts such as "integer" or "IP
address".

Basic data types can be used in `unlang`, as they contain simple
values which can be compared, or assigned to one attribute.  In most
cases, it is not necessary to know the name of the data type.  It is
possible to write values in the format you expect, The server will do
"the right thing" when interpreting the values.

=== Structural Data Types

The following data types are "structural", in that they form
parent-child relationships between attributes.  These data types can
only be used in the dictionaries.  They cannot be used in `unlang`
statements.

|=====
| Data Type     | Description
| struct	| structure which contains fixed-width fields
| tlv		| type-length-value which contains other attributes
| vsa		| Encapsulation of vendor-specific attributes

=== Protocol-Specific Data Types

The following data types are used only in certain protocols.  These
data types can be used only in the dictionaries.  They cannot be used
in `unlang` statements.

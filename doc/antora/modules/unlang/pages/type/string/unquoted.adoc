= Unquoted Strings

Where a series of characters cannot be parsed as a decimal number,
they are interpreted as a simple string composed of one word. This
word is delimited by spaces, or by other tokens, such as `)` in
conditional expressions.

This unquoted text is interpreted as simple strings and are generally
equivalent to placing the string in single quotes.

The interpretation of the text depends on the context, which is
usually defined by an attribute which has a xref:type/index.adoc[data type].

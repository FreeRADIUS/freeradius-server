= Module methods

.Syntax
[source,unlang]
----
<module>.<method>
----

This variant of xref:module.adoc[<module>] is used in one processing
section. It calls a module using the method of another processing
section. For example, it can be used to call a module's `recv
Access-Request` method while processing the `send Access-Accept`
section.

The `<module>` portion must refer to an existing module; the
`<method>` portion must refer to processing method supported by that
module.  Typically, the names of the processing method will be the
same as the `recv` and `send` sections.

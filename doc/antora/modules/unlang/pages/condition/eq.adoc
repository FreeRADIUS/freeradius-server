= The == Operator

.Syntax
`(data-1 == data-2)`

The `==` operator compares the result of evaluating `data-1` and
`data-2`. As discussed in xref:type/index.adoc[Data Types], the `data-1`
field may be interpreted as a reference to an attribute.

The `data-2` field is interpreted in a type-specific manner. For
example, if `data-1` refers to an attribute of type `ipaddr`, then
`data-2` is evaluated as an IP address. If `data-1` refers to an
attribute of type `integer`, then `data-2` is evaluated as an integer
or as a named enumeration defined by a `VALUE` statement in a
dictionary. Similarly, if `data-1` refers to an attribute of type
`date`, then `data-2` will be interpreted as a date string.

If the resulting data evaluates to be the same, then the operator
returns `true`; otherwise, it returns `false`.

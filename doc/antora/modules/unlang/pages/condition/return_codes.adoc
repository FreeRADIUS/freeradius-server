rcode
----

The Unlang interpreter tracks the return code of any module, string expansion
or keyword that has been called.

This return code can be checked in any condition. If the saved return code
matches the `code` given here, then the condition evaluates to `true`.
Otherwise, it evaluates to `false`.

rcodes cannot be set in a condition.  rcodes cannot be compared with anything else.

The list of valid return codes is as follows:

= Attribute References

Attributes in a list may be referenced via one of the following two
syntaxes:

`%{Attribute-Name}` +
`%{<list>:Attribute-Name}`

The `<list>:` prefix is optional. If given, it must be a valid
reference to an xref:list.adoc[attribute list].

If the `<list>:` prefix is omitted, then the `request` list is
assumed.

For EAP methods with tunneled authentication sessions (i.e. PEAP and
EAP-TTLS), the inner tunnel session can refer to a list for the outer
session by prefixing the list name with `outer.` ; for example,
`outer.request`.

When a reference is encountered, the given list is examined for an
attribute of the given name. If found, the variable reference in the
string is replaced with the value of that attribute. Otherwise, the
reference is replacedd with an empty string.

.Examples

`%{User-Name}` +
`%{request.User-Name} # same as above` +
`%{reply.User-Name}` +
`%{outer.request.User-Name} # from inside of a TTLS/PEAP tunnel`

Examples of using references inside of a string:

`"Hello %{User-Name}"` +
`"You, %{User-Name} are not allowed to use %{NAS-IP-Address}"`

== Additional Variations

`%{Attribute-Name[#]}`::
Returns an integer containing the number of named attributes

`%{Attribute-Name[0]}`::

When an attribute appears multiple times in a list, this syntax allows
you to address the attributes as with array entries.  `[0]` refers to
the first attributes, `[1]` refers to the second attribute, etc.

`%{Attribute-Name[*]}`::

Returns a comma-separated string containing all values for the named
attributes.

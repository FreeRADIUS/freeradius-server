= FreeRADIUS Dependencies

Some external dependencies must be installed before building or
running FreeRADIUS. For version 3, the core depends on one
mandatory library: `libtalloc` for memory management.

Many of the modules also have optional dependencies. For example,
the LDAP module requires LDAP client libraries to be installed
and database modules need their respective database client
libraries.

If building from source code, the configure stage will check for
the optional dependencies. Any missing libraries will cause that
particular module to be skipped.

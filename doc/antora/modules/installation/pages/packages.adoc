= Install from packages

Network RADIUS provide pre-built binary packages of FreeRADIUS for
common Linux distributions. This is the recommended installation
method when packages are available for your system.

The official https://packages.inkbridgenetworks.com/[InkBridge Networks
packages] page contains recent FreeRADIUS packages and
installation instructions.

== Distribution-supplied packages

While many Operating System distributions ship FreeRADIUS
packages, the versions they include are often years out of date.
As well as missing out on the latest bug fixes and features, this
also means that it is very hard to know if an issue encountered is
still a problem or if it is fixed in the latest release.

Therefore, whilst the distribution-supplied packages can often be
the most convenient to install, we do not usually recommend using
them.

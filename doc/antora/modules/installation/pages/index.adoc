== Installation

FreeRADIUS is available from multiple sources:

* Official xref:packages.adoc[Network RADIUS packages]
* xref:source.adoc[Source code]
* Many Operating System distributions

We highly recommend using the official packages from Network
RADIUS, where available.

The documents in this section cover details of the above
installation methods, as well as instructions on building
packages locally.

= Release Management

For most of the v3 lifespan, we had released one version after another
in sequence, e.g. 3.0.0, 3.0.1, 3.0.2, etc.  After a while it became
clear that we needed to separate the releases into "stable" and
"feature" releases.

We then move to using 3.0.x as a "stable" version, which had only bug
fixes and security enhancements, and 3.2.x as a "feature" version,
which had new features.  People needing long-term stability could use
3.0.x, and know that new releases had minimal changes.  People needing
new features could use 3.2.x.

We are following a similar release management process with v4, based
on versions:

Major:: The major version number, e.g. "4" for the forseeable future.

Minor:: The minor version number, e.g. 4.0, 4.1, 4.2, etc.

Point:: the "point" release number, e.g. 4.0.1, 4.0.2, etc.

== Stable vs Experimental

The v4 releases are split into two streams, based on whether the minor
version number is even or odd:

* minor numbers which are even are _stable_ and _supported_ releases.
  e.g. 4.0, 4.0.1, 4.2, etc.

** "point" releases (4.0.1, 4.0.2) are 100% compatible within a stable
    release.  Note that "4.0.1" is a stable release because the minor
    number "0" is even, even though the "point" number "1" is odd.

* minor numbers which are odd are _experimental_ or _feature_
  releases.  e.g. 4.1, 4.1.1, 4.3, etc.

** "point" releases (4.1.1, 4.1.2) _are likely to be incompatible_
    with stable releases.  "point" releases _may be incompatible_ with
    other point releases, even within the same major/minor sequence.
+
    e.g. A 4.1.1 release _may_ have functionality and behavior changed
    from the 4.1.0 release.

=== Stable Versions

Stable versions are fully supported by the FreeRADIUS team via the
https://lists.freeradius.org/pipermail/freeradius-users/[mailing
list].  Stable releases are commercially supported by
https://inkbridgenetworks.com[InkBridge Networks].

Once a stable version has been released (e.g. 4.0.0), it is feature
frozen.  The only changes to it will be security fixes, bug fixes,
etc.  No behavior changes will be made, and no new features will be
added.

NOTE: Stable versions can be packaged by OS vendors.

Within a stable version, "point" releases will be made for security
fixes, bug fixes, etc.  So 4.0.1 will be 100% compatible with 4.0.0,
plus 4.0.1 will contain minor fixes.

This guarantee means that all future releases of a stable version will
be compatible with the initial version.  People can install 4.0, and
know that its behavior will never change across "point" releases".

The downside to this approach is that new features will never be added
to a stable version.  That's where experimental versions come in.

=== Experimental Versions

Experimental versions are supported only for testing purposes.  An
experimental version my have breaking changes from a previous stable
version.  A "point" releas of an experimental version may even have
breaking changes from a previous "point" release!

WARNING: Experimental versions must not be packaged by OS vendors.

An experimental version will have minor releases made for new
features, security fixes, bug fixes, etc.  These releases will often
contain breaking changes.

As such, you should only install an experimental version in order to
test or to validate new features.  We do not recommend using an
experimental version in a production environment, unless it is first
validated for your systems.

The purpose of an experimental version is to test new features, and to
allow testing of breaking changes to the server.

In some limited situations, an experimental version may be supported
by https://inkbridgenetworks.com[InkBridge Networks].  However, that
support will be strictly limited to paying customers who use a
specific version that has been approved in advance by the company.

Other people are free to use experimental versions, though doing so
will be at their own risk.  The FreeRADIUS team will accept and fix
bug reports for an experimental version.  However, bug reports which
note incompatibilities with a stable version will not be accepted.  As
the purpose of an experimental version is to change functionality,
such bug reports are inappropriate.

The aboce process is necessary in order to allow the small FreeRADIUS
team to maintain a large and complex product.  There are many projects
supported by much large teams, which have much less functionality!

Compared to other limited products, FreeRADIUS version 4 supports
RADIUS, TACACS+, DHCPv4, DHCPv6, BFD, ARP, "cron" jobs, and LDAP
replication, Each of these protocols can interact with databases such
as OpenLDAP, Microsoft Active Directory, MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite,
Oracle, IBM DB2, Firebird, ODBC2, or Redis.  Each of these protocols
can run complex policies in Unlang, Perl, Python, Lua, etc.

There is a substantial amount of functionality to support, so the core
team has to be careful with their time.

== Rationale

The above release process is necessary to balance a number of different goals:

* the need to never break existing production deployments,
* the need to add new features, and to fix existing but broken features,
* the need to manage multiple releases with a small team.

The use of a "stable" version means that people can be sure that any
"point" releases within that stable version will never break existing
functionality.

For most software products, the development team spends an enormous
amount of time porting features and bug fixes across multiple
releases.  The release management process outlined here means that the
FreeRADIUS team can avoid the bulk of that effort.

This release management process will also let the FreeRADIUS team
develop new features more quickly, as it is easier to "break"
backwards compatibility.  We can change core functionality from 4.0 to
4.2, without worrying about taking down production systems which are
using 4.0.  Instead, those systems can stay on 4.0, and any systems
needing new functionality can use 4.2.

== Guidelines

The following are guidelines for code which goes into a release.

Stable point releases can contain:

* bug fixes
* security fixes

Stable point releases cannot contain:

* new features
* bug fixes which change the behavior of an existing feature.

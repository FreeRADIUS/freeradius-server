FreeRADIUS is a free and open-source implementation of the RADIUS
(Remote Authentication Dial In User Service) protocol. It provides
centralised authentication, authorisation, and accounting (AAA)
support for network access management. FreeRADIUS is a robust,
modular, high-performance server that's deployed in VPNs, Wi-Fi, and
enterprise networks.

The default settings are sufficient for a simple install and basic
functionality. The softwareâ€™s flexibility presents challenges when
configuring it for advanced or specialized environments. There are
many options and customisations for the FreeRADIUS
server. Administrators must decide how and what settings to change,
which may be complex and problematic.

The FreeRADIUS v4 documentation has been significantly revised
compared to version 3. The updated documentation addresses both basic
and advanced questions, covering topics such as how the software
works, how to configure it, and various use cases. Additionally, the
FreeRADIUS team has provided practical examples, developer-focused
information, and extra resources to help users better understand and
deploy the software. This ensures that users of all experience levels
can find the information they need.

== Why v4?

It's obvious why a new major release is a good idea. FreeRADIUS v4 was
necessary to improve protocol support and enhance security. Using a
modernized codebase, a more flexible configuration is available using
virtual servers. This change extends the protocol support for DHCP,
VMPS, and TACAS+, as they are no longer hardcoded into the server
core. Perhaps, a better question is, "Why is v4 taking so long?

Initially, the FreeRADIUS team planned only a minor release of version
3.x. As we examined the codebase, there were many long-standing issues
that needed fixing. Because the core team is small, the v4 rework
required significant time and effort. The team still released a minor
version 3.2 while simultaneously developing version 4. The good news
is that, most of the problematic issues are fixed in v4. The
FreeRADIUS software is more reliable and easier to use.

Here's a short list of the most confusing or complicated v3 issues:

* Access-Request packets are processed though an `authorize` section.
  This legacy naming convention goes back to 2001.

* Run-time functions (dynamic expansions) have a syntax of `%{name:
  args...}`.  The reasons for this are many, but are no longer valid.

* Attributes can't be assigned new values like normal programming
  languages.  You have to use an `update` section.

* Expressions are not supported.  You can't do `foo = 1 + 2`. You have
  to do `update { foo = %{expr: 1 + 2} }`.  This is terrible and
  convoluted.

* Proxying is welded into the server core, which makes it difficult to
  run policies around proxying.
  * There is a `fallback` configuration, but this is specific to
    proxying, and doesn't use the standard module failover mechanisms.
  * It's impossible to send packets as a client, packets can only be
    proxied.  Except for `CoA-Request`, which has a magic
    `originate-coa` functionality.

* Much of the configuration has special-purpose flags or settings for
  special cases.

The result is that configuring the server is more difficult than it
needs to be. These issues needed to be fixed, and they have been
resolved in v4.

Here is a *complete* list of issues remaining in v4, as compared to
most programming languages:

* xref:reference:raddb/mods-available/all_modules.adoc[Modules] are
  run in-place, i.e., they act like language keywords on their own.

* The interpreter tracks
  xref:reference:unlang/return_codes.adoc[return codes] for each
  instruction it runs.

* xref:reference:xlat/all.adoc[Function] calls use a leading `%`,
  e.g., `%length('foo')`.

That's it.

As a result of recent improvements, the server has become much simpler
to understand and configure. However, there are many more benefits to
version 4 as discussed in <<whatsnew, What's new in FreeRADIUS v4>>.

Additionally, the documentation is now structured to help users
navigate and find information efficiently. The content is divided into
main sections and further broken down into sub-sections with smaller,
focused pages. As well, there are links to related topics, making it
easier to access relevant details. This hierarchy allows users to find
the instructions or guidance they need. For example, all the
xref:howto:index.adoc[Howto] guides are a series of small steps to
guide you through a task.

The xref:reference:unlang/index.adoc[unlang policy language] is
thorough and *complete*. All
xref:reference:raddb/index.adoc[configuration files] are fully
documented along with configuration items such as
xref:reference:policy/index.adoc[policies],
xref:reference:raddb/mods-available/index.adoc[modules],
xref:reference:raddb/mods-available/doc/datastore.adoc[datastores] and
xref:reference:raddb/sites-available/index.adoc[virtual servers].

Each xref:reference:unlang/keywords.adoc[keyword] and every
xref:reference:xlat/index.adoc[dynamic expansion] function has a
dedicated documentation page, making it easy for users to find
detailed information about specific features. Additionally, all
xref:reference:raddb/index.adoc[configuration files] are
*automatically* converted to HTML and included in the documentation
tree. This approach ensures that users have convenient access to
up-to-date and comprehensive reference material for every aspect of
the software.

However, some documentation pages may still reference the older
version 3 syntax and examples. These outdated pages are clearly
labeled, and the FreeRADIUS team is actively working to update them.

We hope that this discussion explains why v4 took so long.  We believe
that the result is worth the wait.

[#whatsnew]
== What's new in FreeRADIUS v4

FreeRADIUS v4 is in "alpha" right now.  If FreeRADIUS v4 works,
continue to use.  If you have issues, *return* to using FreeRADIUS
v3.

As of the time of this release, FreeRADIUS:

* Has the abililty to proxy one packet to several destinations.
* Can capture a `failed` proxy, and fall back to local
  authentication.
* Server supports many clients with different shared
  secrets behind one NAT gateway.
* DHCP and VMPS integrated with full functionality and features.
* Server supports TACACS+.
* Connections to databases are `asynchronous` ensuring stable access,
  and prevents server lockups.
* Enums are prefixed with `::`, as in `Service-Type == ::Framed-User`.
  ** The server still doesn't always require (or print) the `::` prefix.  That will change.
  ** By implementing `::` for enums, the requirement to use `&` as a prefix for attribute names is not needed.
  ** This change may require an update to all of the configuration.  We will try to allow `&`, but that may not be possible.
* Dynamic expansions have changed from `%{md5:foo}` to a more standard syntax of `%hash.md5(foo)`.
  ** The new syntax supports multiple comma-separated arguments such as `%function(a, b, c)`.
  ** Expansions such as `%{User-Name}` work in addition to expressions like `%{1+2}` too.
  ** Alternation `%{foo || bar}` supersedes `%{%{foo}:-%{bar}}` now.
* RADIUS/TLS (RadSec) isn't available.
* The "haproxy" and "reverse CoA" features aren't implemented.

Administrators using version 3 that wish to upgrade to version 4 must
read the xref:howto:installation/upgrade.adoc[upgrade] guide.  This
guide explains the differences between the two versions and how an
existing configuration is reproduced in the latest release. Do *not*
use version 3 configuration files with version 4. These configuration
files are *not* compatible on this major version upgrade.

FreeRADIUS version 4 took a long time to incorporate all these
changes. We're confident that the improvements and new features
introduced in version 4 make the extended development period
worthwhile for users.

[WARNING]
====
*Don't* open bug reports about previous features as missing. All such
 bug reports will be closed without comment.

*Don't* create 4.0.0-alpha packages for your operating systems or
 Linux distributions. Creating "alpha" packages results in upset users
 that install that package. The users believed that the package is
 stable and they run into issues.

== Network requirements

A RADIUS server requires a network connection with access to UDP ports
1812 for authentication and 1813 for the accounting traffic. These
ports must be reachable by network devices like access points or VPN
gateways that send authentication requests to the server. All network
devices are configured with the appropriate IP address and network
settings to facilitate communication with clients on the network.

=== Operating systems

The FreeRADIUS protocol works on all Unix based systems.  FreeRADIUS
doesn't run natively under Windows.  If you received a Windows version
of FreeRADIUS, it is illegal.

=== CPU/RAM/disk space requirements

A FreeRADIUS server has minimal requirements. A FreeRADIUS
installation uses 8 MB of RAM, less than 100 MB of disk space, and
minimal CPU power. An Internet Service Provider (ISP) with less than
10,000 users have no issues with a basic setup. ISPs with more than
10,000 users, focuses on system design such as more servers and
databases.

=== Datastores

The server reads or writes to any database and both LDAP and SQL can
be in the same configuration simultaneously. The database queries are
customizable and can be adapted to any custom schema. The server
supports fail-over and load balancing across multiple databases. There
are no pre-set limits to the number, or type, of databases used.

== Debugging

If you have *any* issues with your server, then restart the server in
xref:debugging/radiusd_X.adoc[debugging] mode. Review the logs to
determine what the root cause is and make changes. Do only *one*
change at a time and restart your server.

We start the server with *`-X`*.  This option gives us the best combination of useful output, and readable output.  Adding more `-x` gives *more complex output*,  not *more useful output*.

    $ radiusd -X 2>&1 | tee debugfile

The server prints out the version number, copyright, and license information:

Next, it prints out messages relating to debuggers (e.g. gdb).  These messages are intended for developers, and can generally be ignored by everyone else.

    Getting debug state failed: ptrace capability not set.  If debugger detection is required run as root or: setcap cap_sys_ptrace+ep <path_to_radiusd>

## Reading the configuration files

The next block of messages is about the configuration files.  The server prints out the name of each configuration file it loads.

This output lets you check that the server is loading the files which you think it's loading.  One common issue is that people install multiple versions of the server, and then edit one file while the server is loading a different one.  Reading the debug output will let you verify that you're editing the right file.

    Starting - reading configuration files ...

It then reads the dictionaries.  It does not print out the name of every dictionary file it reads, as there are over 100 files, but they are never the less still loaded.

Next is loads the main `radiusd.conf` file, and some associated ones like `proxy.conf` and `clients.conf`

It now loads all of the modules.  The module configuration is usually stored in `raddb/mods-enabled/`, with one module configuration per file in that directory.

Sometimes the module you're using does not seem to be loaded or used.  In that case, you should check this section to see that the file is loaded.

Next, some policies are loaded.  These policies are ones which the server uses (for example) to canonicalize user names, and to do things like attribute re-writes, sanity checks, etc.

## Server Configuration

Once all of the configuration files are loaded, the server prints out the configuration it is parsing.  Note that it *only prints out what it is using*.  I.e. you can put `foo = bar` into `radiusd.conf`, and the server will load it, but will not print it out in the debug output.

The result is that if you set a configuration item, *it will be printed out in the debug output*.  You should verify that this is the case, especially if it looks like the server is not using the setting you edited.  If the configuration item does not appear in the debug output, *then the server is not using it.*

This is the "main" server configuration:
[%collapsible]
====
    main {
    	name = "radiusd"

Which directories the server is using,

    	prefix = "/"
    	localstatedir = "/var"
    	sbindir = "/usr/sbin"
    	logdir = "/var/log/radius"
    	run_dir = "/var/run/radiusd"
    	libdir = "/usr/lib"
    	radacctdir = "/var/log/radius/radacct"
====

Next we have some generic configuration settings which don't belong anywhere else.
[%collapsible]
====
    	hostname_lookups = no
    	max_request_time = 30
    	cleanup_delay = 5
    	max_requests = 16384
    	pidfile = "/var/run/radiusd/radiusd.pid"
    	checkrad = "/sbin/checkrad"
    	debug_level = 0
    	proxy_requests = yes
====

And the logging configuration.
[%collapsible]
====
     log {
     	stripped_names = no
     	auth = no
     	auth_badpass = no
     	auth_goodpass = no
     	colourise = yes
     	msg_denied = "You are already logged in - access denied"
     }
     resources {
     }
====

The security settings.
[%collapsible]
====
     security {
     	max_attributes = 200
     	reject_delay = 1.000000
     	status_server = yes
     	allow_vulnerable_openssl = "yes"
     }
    }
====

At this point, the server is well on it's way to running.

## Proxy Configuration

The server now loads its proxy configuration, as was defined in `proxy.conf`:

    radiusd: #### Loading Realms and Home Servers ####

The over all proxy configuration is loaded.
[%collapsible]
====
     proxy server {
     	retry_delay = 5
     	retry_count = 3
     	default_fallback = no
     	dead_time = 120
     	wake_all_if_all_dead = no
     }
====

Followed by `home_server` configurations.
[%collapsible]
====
     home_server localhost {
     	ipaddr = 127.0.0.1
     	port = 1812
     	type = "auth"
     	secret = <<< secret >>>
     	response_window = 20.000000
     	response_timeouts = 1
     	max_outstanding = 65536
     	zombie_period = 40
     	status_check = "status-server"
     	ping_interval = 30
     	check_interval = 30
     	check_timeout = 4
     	num_answers_to_alive = 3
     	revive_interval = 120
      limit {
      	max_connections = 16
      	max_requests = 0
      	lifetime = 0
      	idle_timeout = 0
      }
      coa {
      	irt = 2
      	mrt = 16
      	mrc = 5
      	mrd = 30
      }
     }
====

Followed by `home_server_pool` configurations.
[%collapsible]
====
     home_server_pool my_auth_failover {
    	type = fail-over
    	home_server = localhost
     }
====

Followed by `realm` configurations.
[%collapsible]
====
     realm example.com {
    	auth_pool = my_auth_failover
     }
     realm LOCAL {
     }
     realm int {
    	virtual_server = inner-tunnel
     }
====

## Clients

It now loads individual clients:
[%collapsible]
====
    radiusd: #### Loading Clients ####
     client localhost {
     	ipaddr = 127.0.0.1
     	require_message_authenticator = no
     	secret = <<< secret >>>
     	nas_type = "other"
     	proto = "*"
      limit {
      	max_connections = 16
      	lifetime = 0
      	idle_timeout = 30
      }
     }
     client localhost_ipv6 {
     	ipv6addr = ::1
     	require_message_authenticator = no
     	secret = <<< secret >>>
      limit {
      	max_connections = 16
      	lifetime = 0
      	idle_timeout = 30
      }
     }
====

### Auth-Type

The server then creates `Auth-Type`, as set in the virtual servers.  These `Auth-Type` names and values are used by the modules, so they need to be created now.
[%collapsible]
====
     # Creating Auth-Type = mschap
     # Creating Auth-Type = digest
     # Creating Auth-Type = eap
     # Creating Auth-Type = PAP
     # Creating Auth-Type = CHAP
     # Creating Auth-Type = MS-CHAP
====

## Modules

When the server read the module configuration file above (from `raddb/mods-enabled`), that meant just reding the contents of the file.  It is now ready to load the dynamic library which reads that configuration, and which parses the configuration to determine what to do with it.

Each module will print out it's configuration, along with any errors or warnings it sees when it is loading itself.

    radiusd: #### Instantiating modules ####
     modules {

Here is loads the `pap` module.  There are multiple lines being printed at each stage of the process.

First, it discovers it has to load the `pap` module, and decides to do that.

      # Loaded module rlm_pap

Second, it tells you which files is used to read the `pap` module configuration.

      # Loading module "pap" from file /etc/raddb/mods-enabled/pap

Finally, it prints out the configuration that is used by the `pap` module.

      pap {
        normalise = yes
      }

When you are editing a module configuration, it is good to check the debug output for that module, to see:

* Was the module loaded?
* Is it using the file you edited?
* Are the configuration changes you made showing up in the debug output?

Some modules like `expiration` do not have any configuration items, and therefore don't print out any configuration when they are loaded.

      # Loaded module rlm_expiration
      # Loading module "expiration" from file /etc/raddb/mods-enabled/expiration

This module loads the `users` file.
[%collapsible]
====
      # Loaded module rlm_files
      # Loading module "files" from file /etc/raddb/mods-enabled/files
      files {
      	filename = "/etc/raddb/mods-config/files/authorize"
      	acctusersfile = "/etc/raddb/mods-config/files/accounting"
      	preproxy_usersfile = "/etc/raddb/mods-config/files/pre-proxy"
      }
====

The server loads a large number of modules, so we will omit them here.

Finally, it is done loading all modules, and prints this:

     } # modules

### Virtual Servers

Next, it loads "virtual servers".

    radiusd: #### Loading Virtual Servers ####

It prints out the server, and name, along with which file it was loaded from.

    server default { # from file /etc/raddb/sites-enabled/default

It then double-checks the various processing sections.
[%collapsible]
====
     # Loading authenticate {...}
     # Loading authorize {...}
     # Loading preacct {...}
     # Loading accounting {...}
====

The `sql` module is in the default configuration, even if the `sql` module is not enabled.  This warning message is then printed out.

It can be ignored, or, in a production environment where you don't use `sql`, you can just remove references to `sql` from the virtual servers.
[%collapsible]
====
    Ignoring "sql" (see raddb/mods-available/README.rst)
     # Loading post-proxy {...}
     # Loading post-auth {...}
    } # server default
    server inner-tunnel { # from file /etc/raddb/sites-enabled/inner-tunnel
     # Loading authenticate {...}
     # Loading authorize {...}
     # Loading session {...}
     # Loading post-auth {...}
====

In some situations, it tells you where the configuration can be simplified.

     # Skipping contents of 'if' as it is always 'false' -- /etc/raddb/sites-enabled/inner-tunnel:335
    } # server inner-tunnel

## Listen Sections

After loading all of the virtual servers, it then opens the various network sockets used to read and write packets.

    radiusd: #### Opening IP addresses and Ports ####

First, it prints out the configuration for the listen sections.
[%collapsible]
====
    listen {
      	type = "auth"
      	ipaddr = *
      	port = 0
       limit {
       	max_connections = 16
       	lifetime = 0
       	idle_timeout = 30
       }
    }
    listen {
      	type = "acct"
      	ipaddr = *
      	port = 0
       limit {
       	max_connections = 16
       	lifetime = 0
       	idle_timeout = 30
       }
    }
    listen {
      	type = "auth"
      	ipv6addr = ::
      	port = 0
       limit {
       	max_connections = 16
       	lifetime = 0
       	idle_timeout = 30
       }
    }
    listen {
      	type = "acct"
      	ipv6addr = ::
      	port = 0
       limit {
       	max_connections = 16
       	lifetime = 0
       	idle_timeout = 30
       }
    }
    listen {
      	type = "auth"
      	ipaddr = 127.0.0.1
      	port = 18120
    }
====

After reading all of the configuration, it opens the ports, and prints out a list of IP addresses and ports which it is using.
[%collapsible]
====
    Listening on auth address * port 1812 bound to server default
    Listening on acct address * port 1813 bound to server default
    Listening on auth address :: port 1812 bound to server default
    Listening on acct address :: port 1813 bound to server default
    Listening on auth address 127.0.0.1 port 18120 bound to server inner-tunnel
    Listening on proxy address * port 39556
    Listening on proxy address :: port 52609
====

And we finally get to this line.

    Ready to process requests

Once this has been printed, the debug output changes to packet processing.

Note that if *nothing* is ever printed after this line, then the server is not receiving any packets.  No amount of changing the server configuration will solve that problem.  Instead, you must fix the firewall, SeLinux configuration, network routing, etc. so that the OS delivers RADIUS packets to the server.

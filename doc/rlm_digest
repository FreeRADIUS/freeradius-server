	Digest module configuration

0. INTRODUCTION

  The digest module performs HTTP digest authentication, as per
  the IETF draft rfc/draft-sterman-aaa-sip-00.txt.  It has been
  successfully tested against a Cisco SIP server.

  However, the draft has been expired by the IETF, so it's unlikely to
  become an "official" standard.

1. USAGE

  To use this module, uncomment the lines relating to 'digest' from
raddb/radiusd.conf.  Once that is done, any RADIUS request containing
the digest attributes will automatically be authenticated using the
'digest' module.

  Note tha the 'digest' module REQUIRES access to the clear-text
password for the user, in order to perform digest authentication.

2. TESTING

  Add the following lines to the top of your 'raddb/users' file:

#---
test	Auth-Type := Digest, User-Password = "test"
	Reply-Message = "Hello, test with digest"
#---


  Once the server has been re-started (debugging mode is recommended),
  use 'radclient' to send the following packet to the server:

  $  radclient -f digest localhost auth testing123

  Where 'digest' is a file containing:

User-Name = "test", Digest-Response = "631d6d73147add2f9e437f59bbc3aeb7", Digest-Realm = "testrealm", Digest-Nonce = "1234abcd", Digest-Method = "INVITE", Digest-URI = "sip:5555551212@example.com", Digest-Algorithm = "MD5", Digest-User-Name = "test", Message-Authenticator = ""

  You should see the authentication succeed.

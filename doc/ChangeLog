FreeRADIUS 3.2.0 Thu 07 Oct 2021 12:00:00 EDT urgency=low
	Configuration changes
	* "correct_escapes" has been removed, and is always set to
	  "true" internally. Updates may be required if you are using
	  configurations from before 3.0.5.

	Feature improvements
	* Apart from as mentioned above, you can take the 3.0
	  configuration files, and use them in 3.2 without any changes.
	* Add 'reset_day' and '%%r' parameter for rlm_sqlcounter to specify which
	  day of the month the counter should be reset.
	* Add dictionary.mellanox
	* Update dictionary.aruba
	* Partial backport of rlm_json from v4, providing the json_encode xlat.
	  See mods-available/json for documentation.
	* Support for haproxy "PROXY" protocol.
	  See sites-available/tls, "proxy_protocol" and doc/antora/modules/howto/pages/protocols/proxy/
	* Support for sending CoA-Request and Disconnect-Request packets
	  in "reverse" down RadSec tunnels.  Experimental for now, and
	  undocumented.  This will change before 3.2.0 is released.

	Bug fixes
	* All bug fixes from v3.0.x are included in the v3.2.x release.
	* Fix for incomplete home server list after deleting a home
	  server via radmin.

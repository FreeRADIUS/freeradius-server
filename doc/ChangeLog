	  list.  See the upgrade instructions.
	* The EAP module produces much better messages
	  when using TLS.
	* The MySQL and Postgresql modules now call the
	  database string escape functions, instead of
	  using "safe_characters".
	* radmin / raddebug can now stream debug output
	  directly to radmin, instead of using an intermediary
	  file.
	* radsniff stats (-W) now operates on PCAP files too.
	* radsniff stats can be printed in CSV format.
	* Improved internal state API, to simplify multiround
	  authentication.

	* TLV Attributes can now be nested to nearly any depth.
	* radsnmp client which can listen on Net-SNMP "pass persist"

	Bug fixes
	* Attribute names in unlang MUST be prefixed with &
	  This fixes a host of ambiguities when parsing.
	* Added unit tests for dictionary parsing and
	  restrictions on which attributes can appear where.

FreeRADIUS 3.2.0 Thu 21 Apr 2021 12:00:00 EDT urgency=low
	Configuration changes
	* "correct_escapes" has been removed, and is always set to "true"
	  internally. Configuration changes may be required if you are
	  using configurations from before 3.0.5.  Other than this
	  difference, 3.2.x is compatible with 3.0.x, and configurations
	  from 3.0.x can be simply copied into a system running 3.2.x.

	Feature improvements
	* All features from 3.0.x are included in the 3.2.x releases. In addition:
	* Add 'reset_day' and '%%r' parameter for rlm_sqlcounter to specify which
	  day of the month the counter should be reset.
	* Partial backport of rlm_json from v4, providing the json_encode xlat.
	  See mods-available/json for documentation.
	* Support for haproxy "PROXY" protocol.
	  See sites-available/tls, "proxy_protocol" and doc/antora/modules/howto/pages/protocols/proxy/
	* Support for sending CoA-Request and Disconnect-Request packets
	  in "reverse" down RadSec tunnels.  Experimental for now, and
	  undocumented.
	* It is now possible to run a virtual server when saving / loading
	  TLS cache attributes.  See sites-available/tls-cache for
	  more information.
	* Removed the "cram" module.  It was undocumented, and used old
	  and insecure authentication methods.
	* Remove the "otp" module.  The "otpd" program it needs is no longer available,
	  and the module has not been usable since at least 2015.
	* All features from 3.0.x are included in the 3.2.x releases.
	* 3.2.0 requires OpenSSL 1.0.2 or greater.

	Bug fixes
	* All bug fixes from 3.0.x are included in the 3.2.x releases.

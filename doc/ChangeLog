	  controllable format.
	* Added operator support to rlm_python
	* Added %{hex:...} for hex version of raw attribute data
	* Added %{base64:...} for raw attribute data (e.g. 32-bit IP addr),
	  and %{tobase64:...} for the printable string form (e.g. 1.2.3.4),
	  and %{base64tohex:...} to convert a base64 string to a hex string.
	* Use correct terminology when printing errors regarding request/
	  response/message authenticators.
	* Added keytab support to Heimdal Kerberos. Patch from Ryan Steinmetz.
	* radsqlrelay does multiple INSERTs in one transaction.

	* Update Aruba, Alcatel Lucent, APC, BT, PaloAlto, Pureware,
	  Redback, and Mikrotik dictionaries
	* Switch to using SHA1 for certificate digests instead of MD5.

	* Added cache config item to rlm_krb5. When set to "no" ticket
	  caching is disabled which may increase performance.

	Bug fixes
	* Fix CVE-2012-3547.  All users of 2.1.10, 2.1.11, 2.1.12,

	* Fix for Debian bug #606450
	* Mutex lock around rlm_perl Clone routines. Patch from Eike Dehling
	* The passwd module no longer permits "hashsize = 0".  Setting that
	  is pointless for a host of reasons.  It will also break the server.
	* Fix proxied inner-tunnel packets sometimes having zero authentication
	  vector.  Found by Brian Julin.
	* Added $(EXEEXT) to Makefiles for portability.  Closes bug #188.
	* Fix minor build issue which would cause rlm_eap to be built twice.
	* When using "status_check=request" for a home server, the username
	  and password must be specified, or the server will not start.
	* EAP-SIM now calculates keys from the SIM identity, not from the
	  EAP-Identity.  Changing the EAP type via NAK may result in
	  identities changing.  Bug reported by Microsoft EAP team.
	* Use home server src_ipaddr when sending Status-Server packets
	* Decrypt encrypted ERX attributes in CoA packets.
	* Fix registration of internal xlat's so %{mschap:...} doesn't

	* Install rad_counter, for managing rlm_counter files.
	* Add unique index constraint to all SQL flavours so that alternate
	  queries work correctly.
	* The TTLS diameter decoder is now more lenient.  It ignores
	  unknown attributes, instead of rejecting the TTLS session.
	* Use "globfree" in detail file reader.  Prevents very slow leak.
	  Closes bug #207.
	* Operator =~ shouldn't copy the attribute, like :=.  It should
	  instead behave more like ==.
	* Build main Debian package without SQL dependencies
	* Use max_queue_size in threading code
	* Update permissions in raddb/sql/postgresql/admin.sql
	* Added OpenSSL_add_all_algorithms() to fix issues where OpenSSL
	  wouldn't use methods it knew about.
	* Add more sanity checks in dynamic_clients code so the server won't
	  crash if it attempts to load a badly formated client definition.

	  Closes bug #152.
	* Make retry and error message configurable in mschap.
	  See raddb/modules/mschap

	  This matches what users expect, and reduces confusion.
	* Fix configure checks for udpfromto.  Fixes Debian bug #606866

	Feature improvements
	* Install the "radcrypt" program.
	* Enable radclient to send requests containing MS-CHAPv1
	  Send packets with: MS-CHAP-Password = "password".  It will
	  be automatically converted to the correct MS-CHAP attributes.
	* Added "-t" command-line option to radtest.  You can use "-t pap",
	 "-t chap", "-t mschap", or "-t eap-md5".  The default is "-t pap"
	* Make the "inner-tunnel" virtual server listen on 127.0.0.1:18120
	  This change and the previous one makes PEAP testing much easier.
	* Added more documentation and examples for the "passwd" module.
	* Added dictionaries for RFC 5607 and RFC 5904.
	* Added note in proxy.conf that we recommend setting
	  "require_message_authenticator = yes" for all home servers.
	* Added example of second "files" configuration, with documentation.
	  This shows how and where to use two instances of a module.
	* Updated radsniff to have it write pcap files, too.  See '-w'.
	* Print out large WARNING message if we send an Access-Challenge
	  for EAP, and receive no follow-up messages from the client.
	* Added Cached-Session-Policy for EAP session resumption.  See
	  raddb/eap.conf.

	  legacy RADIUS systems.
	* Add Module-Failure-Message for mschap module (ntlm_auth)
	* made rlm_sql_sqlite database configurable.  Use "filename"
	  in sql{} section.
	* Added %{tolower: ...string ... }, which returns the lowercase
	  version of the string.  Also added %{toupper: ... } for uppercase.

	Bug fixes
	* Fix endless loop when there are multiple sub-options for
	  DHCP option 82.
	* More debug output when sending / receiving DHCP packets.
	* EAP-MSCHAPv2 should return the MPPE keys when used outside
	  of a TLS tunnel.  This is needed for IKE.
	* Added SSL "no ticket" option to prevent SSL from creating sessions
	  without IDs.  We need the IDs, so this option should be set.
	* Fix proxying of packets from inside a TTLS/PEAP tunnel.
	  Closes bug #25.
	* Allow IPv6 address attributes to be created from domain names
	  Closes bug #82.
	* Set the string length to the correct value when parsing double
	  quotes.  Closes bug #88.
	* No longer look users up in /etc/passwd in the default configuration.

	* More #ifdef's to enable building on systems without certain
	  features.
	* Fixed SQL-Group comparison to register only if the group
	  query is defined.
	* Fixed SQL-Group comparison to register <instance>-SQL-Group,
	  just like rlm_ldap.  This lets you have multiple SQL group checks.
	* Fix scanning of octal numbers in "unlang".  Closes bug #89.
	* Be less aggressive about freeing "stuck" requests.  Closes bug #35.
	* Fix example in "originate-coa" to refer to the correct packet.
	* Change default timeout for dynamic clients to 1 hour, not 1 day.
	* Allow passwd module to map IP addresses, too.
	* Allow passwd module to be used for CoA packets
	* Put boot filename into DHCP header when DHCP-Boot-Filename
	  is specified.
	* raddb/certs/Makefile no longer has certs depend on index.txt and
	   serial.  Closes bug #64.
	* Ignore NULL errorcode in PostgreSQL client.  Closes bug #39
	* Made Exec-Program and Exec-Program-Wait work in accounting
	  section again.  See sites-available/default.
	* Fix long-standing memory leak in esoteric conditions.  Found
	  by Jerry Nichols.
	* Added "Password-With-Header == userPassword" to raddb/ldap.attrmap
	  This will automatically convert more passwords.
	* Updated rlm_pap to decode Password-With-Header, if it was base64
	  encoded, and to treat the contents as potentially binary data.
	* Fix Novell eDir code to use the right function parameters.
	  Closes bug #86.
	* Allow spaces to be escaped when executing external programs.
	  Closes bug #93.
	* Be less restrictive about checking permissions on control socket.
	  If we're root, allow connecting to a non-root socket.
	* Remove control socket on normal server exit.  If the server isn't
	  running, the control socket should not exist.
	* Use MS-CHAP-User-Name as Name field from EAP-MSCHAPv2 for MS-CHAP
	  calculations.  It *MAY* be different (upper / lower case) from
	  the User-Name attribute.  Closes bug #17.
	* If the EAP-TLS methods have problems, more SSL errors are now
	  available in the Module-Failure-Message attribute.
	* Update Oracle configure scripts.  Closes bug #57.
	* Added text to DESC fields of doc/examples/openldap.schema
	* Updated more documentation to use "Restructured Text" format.
	  Thanks to James Lockie.
	* Fixed typos in raddb/sql/mssql/dialup.conf.  Closes bug #11.
	* Return error for potential proxy loops when using "-XC"
	* Produce better error messages when slow databases block
	  the server.
	* Added notes on DHCP broadcast packets for FreeBSD.
	* Fixed crash when parsing some date strings.  Closes bug #98
	* Improperly formatted Attributes are now printed as "Attr-##".
	  If they are not correct, they should not use the dictionary name.
	* Fix rlm_digest to be check the format of the Digest attributes,
	  and return "noop" rather than "fail" if they're not right.
	* Enable "digest" in raddb/sites-available/default.  This change
	  enables digest authentication to work "out of the box".
	* Be less aggressive about marking home servers as zombie.
	  If they are responding to some packets, they are still alive.
	* Added Packet-Transmit-Counter, to track detail file retransmits.
	  Closes bug #13.
	* Added configure check for lt_dladvise_init().  If it exists, then
	  using it solves some issues related to libraries loading libraries.
	* Added indexes to the MySQL IP Pool schema.
	* Print WARNING message if too many attributes are put into a packet.
	* Include dhcp test client (not built by default)
	* Added checks for LDAP constraint violation.  Closes bug #18.
	* Change default raddebug timeout to 60 seconds.
	* Made error / warning messages more consistent.
	* Correct back-slash handling in variable expansion.  Closes bug #46.
	  You SHOULD check your configuration for backslash expansion!
	* Fix typo in "configure" script (--enable-libltdl-install)
	* Use local libltdl in more situations.  This helps to avoid
	  compile issues complaining about lt__PROGRAM__LTX_preloaded_symbols.
	* Fix hang on startup when multiple home servers were defined
	  with "src_ipaddr" field.
	* Fix 32/64 bit issue in rlm_ldap.  Closes bug #105.
	* If the first "listen" section defines 127.0.0.1, don't use that
	  as a source IP for proxying.  It won't work.
	* When Proxy-To-Realm is set to a non-existent realm, the EAP module
	  should handle the request, rather than expecting it to be proxied.
	* Fix IPv4 issues with udpfromto.  Closes bug #110.
	* Clean up child processes of raddebug.  Closes bugs #108 and #109
	* retry OTP if the OTP daemon fails.  Closes bug #58.
	* Multiple calls to ber_printf seem to work better.  Closes #106.
	* Fix "unlang" so that "attribute not found" is treated as a "false"
	  comparison, rather than a syntax error in the configuration.
	* Fix issue with "Group" attribute.

FreeRADIUS 2.1.9 Mon 24 May 8:00:00 CEST 2010, urgency=medium
	Feature improvements
	* Add radmin command "stats detail <file>" to see what
	  is going on inside of a detail file reader.
	* Added documentation for CoA.  See raddb/sites-available/coa
	* Add sub-option support for Option 82.  See dictionary.dhcp
	* Add "server" field to default SQL NAS table, and documented it.

	Bug fixes
	* Reset "received ping" counter for Status-Server checks.  In some
	  corner cases it was not getting reset.
	* Handle large VMPS attributes.
	* Count accounting responses from a home server in SNMP / statistics
	  code.
	* Set EAP-Session-Resumed = Yes, not "No" when session is resumed.
	* radmin packet counter statistics are now unsigned, for numbers
	  2^31..2^32.  After that they roll over to zero.
	* Be more careful about expanding data in PAP and MS-CHAP modules.
	  This prevents login failures when passwords contain '{'.
	* Clean up zombie children if there were many "exec" modules being
	  run for one packet, all with "wait = no".
	* re-open log file after HUP.  Closes bug #63.
	* Fix "no response to proxied packet" complaint for Coa / Disconnect
	  packets.  It shouldn't ignore replies to packets it sent.
	* Calculate IPv6 netmasks correctly.  Closes bug #69.
	* Fix SQL module to re-open sockets if they unexpectedly close.
	* Track scope for IPv6 addresses.  This lets us use link-local
	  addresses properly.  Closes bug #70.
	* Updated Makefiles to no longer use the shell for recursing into
	  subdirs.  "make -j 2" should now work.
	* Updated raddb/sql/mysql/ippool.conf to use "= NULL".  Closes
	  bug #75.
	* Updated Makefiles so that "make reconfig" no longer uses the shell
	  for recursing into subdirs, and re-builds all "configure" files.
	* Used above method to regenerate all configure scripts.
	  Closes bug #34.
	* Updated SQL module to allow "server" field of "nas" table
	  to be blank: "".  This means the same as it being NULL.
	* Fixed regex realm example.  Create Realm attribute with value
	  of realm from User-Name, not from regex.  Closes bug #40.
	* If processing a DHCP Discover returns "fail / reject", ignore
	  the packet rather than sending a NAK.
	* Allow '%' to be escaped in sqlcounter module.
	* Fix typo internal hash table.
	* For PEAP and TTLS, the tunneled reply is added to the reply,
	  rather than integrated via the operators.  This allows multiple
	  VSAs to be added, where they would previously be discarded.
	* Make request number unsigned.  This changes nothing other than
	  the debug output when the server receives more than 2^31 packets.
	* Don't block when reading child output in 'exec wait'.  This means
	  that blocked children get killed, instead of blocking the server.
	* Enabled building without any proxy functionality
	* radclient now prefers IPv4, to match the default server config.
	* Print useful error when a realm regex is invalid
	* relaxed rules for preprocess module "with_cisco_vsa_hack".  The
	  attributes can now be integer, ipaddr, etc.  (i.e. non-string)

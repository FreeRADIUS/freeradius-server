FreeRADIUS 3.0.2 Mon 13 Jan 2014 14:30:00 EDT urgency=medium
	Feature improvements
	* Allow cast (and implicit conversion) of integers to IPv4 addresses
	* More xlats allow attribute references.  This means they can
	  operate on binary data.  expr, base64, md5, sha1.
	* Added more tests
	* The dictionaries are now auto-loaded.  raddb/dictionary
	  no longer needs to $INCLUDE ${prefix}/share/dictionary
	* A "panic_action" can be set to have the server dump a gdb
	  log on SEGV or other fatal error.

	Bug fixes
	* Fix SQL groups.
	* Fix operation of fr_strerror() with RE*() macros.
	* Don't assert if the connection were trying to reconnect
	  is not in_use.
	* Fix %{mschap:User-Name} xlat.
	* Allow comparisons of signed integers and ethernet addresses.
	* Fix parsing of text based ascend binary filters
	* Fix a few minor Coverity and clang analyzer issues.
	* Log WARNING prefixes only once, not twice.
	* Allow '&' in more xlat expansions.
	* Fix attribute truncation seen in Perl and other places.
	* Use correct port when DHCP relaying.
	* Fix behaviour on FreeBSD where sending packets from an interface
	  bound to an IP address would fail when the server was built with
	  udpfromto.

FreeRADIUS 3.0.1 Mon 13 Jan 2014 14:30:00 EDT urgency=medium
	Feature improvements
	* Add "timeout" to exec, and "ntlm_auth_timeout" to mschap.
	  So that run-away child processes are caught earlier.
	* Allow TLS clients to use "proto = tls", in which case
	  TLS is required.  The shared secret is then set to "radsec".
	* More documentation in the tls virtual server.
	* Add "date" module for date formatting.
	  See raddb/mods-available/date.
	* Added unit test suite for internal server functionality
	* When loading "update" sections, check if the RHS is a literal
	  value.  If so, syntax check it immediately.
	* Update LDAP module documentation and functionality.
	  The generic attribute can now update lists.
	* Updated dictionary.extreme.
	* Update sqlippool to do clears as a separate transaction,
	  and at most once per second.  This should help MySQL.
	* Respect control:Response-Packet-Type for all types of
	  requests.
	* Add support for SSL encryption to the MySQL driver.
	* Allow arbitrary connection parameters to be used with the
	  PostgreSQL driver.
	* Changes to the OpenLDAP schema to fully expose functionality
	  of the new LDAP module.
	* Update debian packaging to include a freeradius-config
	  package. This package may be provided as a site local
	  package to avoid fighting with the preinstalled config
	  files.

	Bug fixes
	* Use correct field for ARP setting in DHCP.
	* Fix crash on debug condition (#454).
	* Fix a number of minor issues caught by the clang
	  analyzer.
	* Set WARNING messages to yellow instead of normal text.
	* Correct debug colorise logic.  Patch from Phil Mayers.
	* Encode attributes of type "ethernet".  No one uses them,
	  but it makes sense.
	* Work around regex initialization issues.
	* Fix build when linking against OpenSSL.
	* Print IDs as positive numbers, which helps for large DHCP
	  XIDs.
	* Fix issue with sql_ippool.
	* sqlcounter now uses 64-bit counters, to deal with 4G overflow.
	* Fix issues with DHCP subsystem.
	* Don't build / install disabled modules, or their config
	  files.
	* Fix build for OSX Mavericks, which hid the header files
	  in a magical place.
	* Fix LEAP buffer issue.  You should still avoid LEAP.
	* Mark "unknown" WiMAX attributes as being WiMAX.
	* Fix typo in packet decoder for fragmented extended attrs
	* RPM spec fixes.
	* Fix rlm_perl build issues when not using threads.
	* Enable %{Response-Packet-Type} again.
	* Update configuration file parser to handle "bool"
	  consistently.
	* Update declarations of global boolean variables to use
	  "bool" consistently. This fixes an issue where some
	  modules were instantiated in "config check" mode and
	  did not work correctly.
	* Make more messages debug instead of info, to avoid
	  polluting the logs with messages that can't be fixed.
	* Set operator in internal unlang code to suppress spurious
	  warning messages.
	* Fix debian packaging.
	* Added "status" to Debian init script.
	* Fix "update outer.request" to update the outer request.
	* Don't print TLS debugging messages when not in debug mode.
	* Correctly manage counters for "limit" sections of TCP / TLS
	  "listen" sockets.
	* Fix libldap debug output.
	* Fix rlm_ldap tls functionality.
	* Initialise OpenSSL globals early to avoid issues with the
	  PostgreSQL library.
	* Fix typo in sqlcounter expansion code.  Fixes #463
	* Overwrite previous instances of SQL-User-Name when adding
	  it to the request.
	* Work around bugs in both MIT and heimdal versions of
	  krb5_copy_context(), which caused segfaults in
	  multithreaded mode.
	* Provide meaningful error messages if Heimdal krb5 is used.
	* Fix attribute supression in rlm_detail.
	* Exit with error code if child fails to complete server
	  initialisation after forking.  This allows init scripts to
	  correctly report whether the server started ok.

FreeRADIUS 3.0.0 Mon  7 Oct 2013 15:48:14 EDT urgency=medium
	Feature improvements
	* Documentation for upgrading from 2.x is in raddb/README.rst
	  Please follow it.  It will make the upgrade easier.
	* Moved configuration entries in radiusd.conf to make more sense.
	* Added the "integer64" and "ipv4prefix" data types.
	* Added RADIUS over TLS (i.e. RadSec). See raddb/sites-available/tls
	* Updated internal API to support new attributes and formats
	* Added code to send SNMP Traps.  See raddb/trigger.conf.
	* Added preliminary support for Apple's Grand Central Dispatch
	* Added provisions for raddb/dictionary.local, for local changes.
	  See raddb/dictionary for more details.
	* Added packet/s tracking. See max_pps in the "listen" section.
	* The %{} expansions and "unlang" conditions are now parsed at server
	  start. Descriptive errors are produced for syntax and format errors.
	* Casting is now supported for "unlang" comparisons.  See "man unlang"
	  e.g. <ipaddr>127.0.0.1 == Framed-IP-Address.
	* Direct comparison of attribute references is now supported.
	  e.g. &Foo == &Bar.  This avoids stringification of the attributes.
	* Direct assignment of attributes is now supported.
	  e.g. Foo := &Bar.  It also works for "octets" data types.
	* Comparisons of IPv4 and IPv6 prefixes are now supported.
	  The "<" operator means "within the prefix" for comparisons.
	* New sha1 xlat expansion (thanks to Alan Buxey)
	* Colourised log messages when logging to stdout.  Look for yellow
	  warnings and red errors.  Doing this will save you a LOT of grief.
	* If the PCRE library is available, use it (insted of the POSIX
	  functions) to process regular expressions (thanks to Phil Mayers).
	* -xv now displays all the features the server was built with, and
	  the versions of the core libraries (libtalloc, libssl).

	Module Changes
	* Moved raddb/modules/ to raddb/mods-available/, and raddb/mods-enabled/,
	  following the examples of other projects.
	* Additional files for each module are now in raddb/mods-config/.
	  See raddb/mods-config/README.rst for documentation.
	* Moved "users" to raddb/mods-config/files/authorize
	* Moved "hints" and "huntgroups" to raddb/mods-config/preprocess/
	* Moved eap.conf to mods-available/eap
	* Moved sql.conf to mods-available/sql
	* Moved TLS configuration for EAP into a common subsection.
	  See raddb/mods-available/eap, "tls-config" section.
	* Added for MS-CHAP Change Password from Phil Mayers.
	  See raddb/mods-available/mschap, "passchange" subsection.
	* Added EAP-PWD implementation from Dan Harkins
	* Added connection pools for modules. This unifies connection
	  management which was previously different for different modules.
	* SQL now uses the connection pool.  See mods-available/sql
	* SQL now supports arbitrary Acct-Status-Types.
	  These changes are not compatible with 2.x.
	* SQL now has full support for SQLite.  See raddb/sql/main/sqlite/
	* SQLite supports auto-creation of new databases on server startup for
	  bootstrapping purposes.
	* LDAP now uses the connection pool.  The LDAP module has been
	  completely re-written for performance and simplicity.
	* LDAP now caches groups.  This makes multiple group checks MUCH
	  faster.
	* Removed all limitations on 253 octet attributes.  RFC 6929 allows
	  for attributes up to 4K in length.
	* New rlm_idn module providing an expansion for performing IDNA encoding
	of internationalized domain names.  Thanks to 'skids'.
	* New rlm_yubikey module to validate yubikey OTP tokens.
	  See raddb/modules/yubikey

	Bug fixes
	* All known bug fixes from 2.2.x are included.
	* Removed "addport" functionality.
	* Removed many unused or duplicate modules.  See raddb/README.rst.

	Internal / API changes:
	* All traces of the old build system have been removed.
	  The new build system is faster and simpler.
	* clang is fully supported.
	* We now use "talloc" for memory management.  A number of new
	  features required this change.  Thanks to the Samba people!
	* Many internal APIs have been updated to use talloc.
	* New API for iterating over VALUE_PAIRs.  This is in preparation
	  for attributes, in version 3.1.
	* No new code should directly modify any field of a VALUE_PAIR.
	* VALUE_PAIRs contain pointers to DICT_ATTR instead of containing
	  attribute and vendor fields.  This will allow nested attributes.
	* Some protocol specific code has been moved out into proto_* modules.
	  More will come in subsequent versions.  See proto_dhcp and proto_vmps.
	* Standardised internal logging macros.  radlog() should not be used.
	  See src/include/log.h
	* Use OpenSSL hashing functions when available.
	* The server now builds with no warnings on most platforms.
	* New RADIUS encoder/decoder, to support new formats.
	* Added RFC 6929 "extended attributes", via the new encoder/decoder.
	* Added full WiMAX support, via the new encoder/decoder.  The old
	  code could not handle some unusual corner cases.

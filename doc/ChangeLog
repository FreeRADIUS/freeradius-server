FreeRADIUS 1.0.0 ; $Date$, urgency=low

	* Many, many minor bug fixes and feature enhancements.
	* Fix a bug in the attr_filter module, which would throw away
	  the tag from tagged attributes.
	* Added "reject" action in configurable failover for modules
	* Bug fixes to thread handling from Malcolm Caldwell.
	* added ability for mschap module to use ntlm_auth, to perform
	  MS-CHAPv1 and MS-CHAPv2 authentication against a Windows
	  Domain Controller.
	* Allow checking of EAP identity against certificate.
	* Added a "listen" directive, which supersedes the old
	  "bind_address" and "port" directives.  "listen" allows much
	  finer-grained control over what IP's, ports, and packets the
	  server pays attention to.
	* Preliminary tests indicate that the server builds and runs on
	  Interix (SFU).
	* Regular expression matches in brackets can now be referenced
	  as in Perl, via %{1}, %{2}, etc.
	* Check return value from registered xlat functions. If return
	  value is 0, treat the attribute as not found.  This lets things
	  like %{sql: select... :-FAILED} work.
	* EAP module configuration is now in "raddb/eap.conf", as it was
	  getting large.
	* Realms can now be configured to ignore DEFAULT and NULL
	  realms.  This makes prefix/suffix realms co-exists a little
	  better.
	* Added "man" pages for many of the modules.
	* Added many new dictionaries: 3GPP, 3GPP2, Propel, Karlnet,
	  Sonicwall, Navini, Bristol University, Valemont, Mikrotik.
	* Fixed a bug in libltdl which printed the wrong error message
	  when trying to link to a library.  Found by Paul Stewart.
	* Updates to radclient, so that you can specify multiple '-f'
	  options, and it will send those packets in parallel.  This
	  allows for significantly higher packet rates when load testing.
	* Added red-black tree implementation to src/lib.  The
	  dictionaries now use it, rather than singly linked lists.  Tests
	  indicate that the server is up to 30% faster.
	* Updated MSCHAP module to be able to better deal with Windows
	  machines which put a username with domain into User-Name, but
	  which use only the username to create the MS-CHAP-Response.
	* Added many more "man" pages for the modules.
	* Made "hints" file more generic and flexible, without changing
	  old functionality.
	* Correct error condition in rlm_krb5.  Patch from Jon Moore.
	* Added demo certs.
	* Updates to configure scripts for MySQL.
	* Enhanced configuration file variable handling.  See
	  doc/variables.txt for details.
	* doc/configurable_failover is now understandable by mere humans.
	* Updates for 64-bit systems.
	* Update scripts/rc.radiusd with examples of how to deal with
	  shared library issues.
	* Checks for OpenSSL now enforce version number, and are common
	  across all modules, rather than being duplicated.
	* Patch to make ctime_r work on non-compliant platforms.
	  Patch from Oliver Graf.
	* Implement "udpfromto", which allows the server to work better in
	  LVS.  Code from Jan Berkel and Miquel van Smoorenburg.  To use
	  it, do:   ./configure --with-udpfromto=yes
	* Re-arranged "walk over cached requests" code for clarity.
	* The server now keeps more SNMP statistics about the packets it
	  has processed.
	* De-coupled the queue of input requests from the pool of threads.
	  This allows "spikes" of requests to be queued, even though all
	  threads are busy.  This change significantly increases the
	  servers ability to process large numbers of requests on a
	  multi-CPU machine.
	* Re-arranged the internal "core" request handling code, to
	  make a little more sense.
	* Removed support for Replicate-To-Realm.  Use radrelay.
	* Print & parse unknown attributes as Attr-%d, Vendor-%d-Attr-%d,
	  or VendorName-Attr-%d.
	* Updated doc/tuning_guide, with comments about SQL.
	* Added EAP-SIM.
	* Enabled proxying of the authentication request which is tunneled
	  inside of PEAP and TTLS.
	* rlm_passwd is now marked "stable", and has many bugs fixed.
	* More flexible configuration for rlm_ldap.
	* Added EAP-PEAP support, with tunneled EAP-MSCHAP-V2.
	  Patch from Masao Nishiku.  (Many, many thanks!)
	* Updates to rlm_ippool for stability.
	* Added ippool_tool, by Edwin Groothuis.
	* Catch packets which are just about 4K in size.
	   Bug found by Nils-Henner Krueger.
	* New implementation of parser for Ascend's data filter
	  attributes, that is now thread-safe and GPL'd.
	* EAP-TLS now checks Certificate Revocation List
	* Preliminary (not entirely complete) support for IPv6 attributes,
	  including IFID.
	* Updated GPL boilerplate in the source.
	* Added new RFC's to doc/rfc/
	* Many fixes to the SQL module & sub-modules.
	* Added EAP-TTLS support in rlm_eap.  Tested with many clients.
	* Added support for rejected packets to run an Post-Auth-Type REJECT
	  stanza instead of skipping post-auth entirely.
	* Added support for %{*:Packet-Type} translation. (Not for %{check:})
	* Added support for %{check:Attribute-Name} to go with
	  %{request:Attribute-Name} and the like.
	* Add support to rlm_sql for post-authentication query execution.
	* Add support to rlm_sql for accounting_update_query_alt
	* Add support to checkrad.pl for microtek-brand NASs over SNMP
	* Add support for supplementary groups of switched-to user

FreeRADIUS 0.9.0 ; Date: 2003/07/04 21:01:29, urgency=low

	* Many, many, bug fixes and feature enhancements.
	* radrelay now updates packet 'id' on retransmissions.
	* More checks for thread-safe functions.
	* Fix CHAP related buffer overflow (ouch!), thanks to Masao NISHIKU.
	* Issue warnings if deprecated configuration files are used.
	* rlm_passwd can now add items to the reply, request, or config items.
	* The rlm_digest, rlm_exec, and rlm_ippool modules are now marked

	* Removed 'raduse'.  No one has used it for years.
	* Massive fixes for Debian packaging.
	* radclient can now send "disconnect" packets, to NASes which
	  support it.  The server, however, CANNOT send disconnect packets.
	* Made Auth-Type, Acct-Type, etc. names consistent across
	  dictionary files and radiusd.conf.  The old (inconsistent) names
	  are still allowed for backwards compatibility.
	* Cleaned up problems with the rlm_sql module.
	* Updates to the rlm_ldap module.
	* rlm_mschap no longer reads SMB password files.  See rlm_passwd,

	  we are looking for the NULL entry and it doesn't exist. Bug
	  noted by Nathan Miller.
	* Disable child process spawning if we don't have threads.
	  The code doesn't work, so it's better to force the server
	  to run in single-process mode.
	* New rlm_exec module, which allows a more generic way of
	  executing external programs.
	* Preliminary large file support in 'configure' and in the server,
	  to support 2G+ detail files.
	* Install documentation into /usr/local/share/doc/freeradius

	* Added Juniper dictionary.
	* Added Cisco VPN3000, VPN5000, and BBSM dictionaries.
	* New platform-neutral 'rc.radiusd'
	* Configuration files with private information get chmod'd
	  0600 after installation.
	* Preliminary support for clean shutdowns when a SIGTERM is
	  received.
	* SNMP timeouts for checkrad, so there will be fewer situations
	  where it hangs for 30 seconds...
	* Added code to clean up modules and memory when asked to exit
	  via SIGTERM.
	* Removed all need for the old-style 'naslist' and 'client' files,
	  and noted that they are deprecated.
	* Added support for Status-Server packets, stolen shamelessly
	  from Cistron RADIUSD.  This is despite the RFC's saying such
	  things are wrong.
	* Bug fixes to rlm_dbm.
	* Updates for checkrad, max40xx routine, from Aleksandr Kuzminsky.
	* Disable caching of passwords for the Unix module.  It was

	* doc/aaa.txt describes how the server works.
	* More uniform encoding/decoding of passwords, so that they will
	  be seen as clear-text where possible.
	* radwho and radzap now read 'radiusd.conf' to discover where the
	  radutmp files are located.  Patch from Andrea Gabellini.
	* Preliminary 'expression' module, to allow you to do cool things
	  like:    Session-Timeout = `%{expr:3600 - %{sql:SELECT ...}}`
	* Added ability to do xlat on check items, and reply items,
	  so that the value of the reply attributes can be dynamically
	  generated.
	* Added MIBs, taken from the RFC's.  This makes SNMP queries to
	  the server a little easier to set up.
	* Don't SEGV when we receive a packet which is larger than the
	  size claimed in the RADIUS portion.  Patch from Vaughn Skinner.
	* SNMP patches from Harrie Hazewinkel.

	* Cleaned up experimental rlm_smb, so that it builds on more
	  platforms.
	* Don't over-write request->reply->vps with the Reply-Message,
	  when doing authentication rejects with Exec-Program-Wait.

	  with only an 'xlat' function can be registered.
	* Allow '{' and '}' in xlat'd strings.
	* C++ compatibility patch from Andrey Kotrekhov, for libradius.
	* Automatically decrypt/encrypt User-Password, so that debugging
	  mode will print out the text password, and not the random
	  garbage it previously showed.
	* Cleaned up header files and function prototypes for the SQL
	  sub-modules.
	
FreeRADIUS 0.7 ; Date: 2002/07/26 18:01:50 , urgency=high

	  Bug found by Loh John Wu <ljwu@sandvine.com>
	* Add 'Realm' attribute, even if it's a LOCAL realm.
	  Bug noted by Chris Brotsos.
	* Added experimental SMB authentication module, which uses
	  PAP passwords to authenticate against an NT-Domain.
	  NT/LM-passwords are not currently supported.
	* More documentation for rlm_passwd, rlm_mschap, and rlm_digest.
	* 'configure' changes to better find sem_init and friends.
	* Allow the use of previously installed libtool, and libltdl.
	  This appears to help a lot on FreeBSD.
	* Fixes to work on non-threaded builds.
	  Patch from Rainer Weikusat.
	* SQL now re-connects to the server, if the connection is lost.
	  Currently only MySQL is fixed, but other patches will follow.
	  Patch from Todd T. Fries.
	* Added experimental use of dynamicly translated variables,
	  CallBack-Number = `%{request:Calling-Station-Id}`
	  sets the value of the CallBack-Number attribute to the value of
	  the Calling-Station-Id in the original request.
	* Cute hack: Allow regex matching on IP addresses, by placing
	  the string representation of the IP address (1.2.3.4) into
	  the internal data structure.  This allows things like
	  NAS-IP-Address =~ "^192\.168", which may be useful.
	* Add documentation for experimental rlm_dbm module.
	* Added experimental Perl module.
	* Added the relevant IETF RFC's (standards documents) to 'doc/rfc',
	  along with some simple perl scripts to convert them to cross-
	  referenced HTML.
	* Updated the experimental Python module.
	* Added Cisco SSG VSA's
	* When rejecting authentication due to external Exec-Program, do
	  NOT free the reply pairs, as the server core will take care of
	  doing that.  Bug noted by Thomas Jalsovsky
	* New experimental module: rlm_cram
	  Supports APOP, CRAM-MD5, CRAM-MD4, CRAM-SHA1 with it's own
	  VSA's. This module may be used for SMTP/POP3/IMAP4 server
	  authentication.

		http://www.freeradius.org/cvs-log/
	* Change to the user/group specified in the config file in all
	  modes ( debug and daemon ).
	* SQL sockets are rotated so that all are used, to prevent the
	  SQL server timing out and closing unused sockets.  Patch from
	  Todd T. Fries
	* Sybase driver from mattias@nogui.se.
	* Modules are now versioned.
	* Delete garbage Proxy-Reply attributes sent by the home server
	  before performing our own reply.

	  different auth/acct servers for the same realms.
	  Patch from Eddie Stassen.
	* Minor updates to encrypted tunnel passwords.
	* Default 'run_dir' is now /var/run/radiusd, not var/run.
	  /var/run is writeable only by root, and radiusd may be run suid.
	* Modules are now versioned, so that upgrading the server
	  ensures that the new modules are installed.
	* Fix sql code, so that magic SQL characters don't get the
	  SQL server excited.
	* Remove references to "UNKNOWN-NAS" in log messages.
	* Properly handle fork() and obtaining child processes exit
	  status when using threads.  (pthread is broken w.r.t. signals)
	* Correct code which would send erroneous reject, when the reject
	  was delayed, and a new request came in.
	* Fix race condition where proxied requests would sometimes never
	  be re-sent.  Bug noted by Eddie Stassen.
	* Corrected LDAP3 schema
	* Implemented Digest authentication, as per IETF document
	  draft-sterman-aaa-sip-00.txt, to perform authentication against
	  a Cisco SIP server.
	* If no password or group files have been specified in the config,
	  use the standard system calls to find them, rather than giving
	  up.  Patch from Steve Langasek.	
	* Return Proxy-State attributes in a delated Access-Reject
	* Corrected 'session zap' logic, when an old and unused session
	  is deleted from the databases.  Accounting packets with garbage
	  Client-IP-Address attributes should no longer be a problem.
	* Bug fixed in LDAP attribute map, for MS-CHAP related attributes.
	* Fixes to the EAP module to work better with XP.
	* Support for MS-SQL, using the FreeTDS library,
	  from Dmitri Ageev

	* Fix rlm_realm, to allow seperate proxying of accounting and
	  authentication requests.
	* Bug fixes in PostgreSQL back-end, from Andrew Kukhta.
	* Increase internal buffers, to allow large SQL query strings.
	* Added debug level 3 (-xxx), where debug messages have time stamps.
	* Fix 'radwho' to use the correct radutmp file, as found by
	  'configure' (but radwho still doesn't read radiusd.conf)
	* Fix bugs in tunnel (tagged attribute) code, which would prevent
	  tagged attributes from being generated correctly in a packet.
	* Build only 'stable' modules by default.  Experimental modules
	  require --with-experimental-modules to be passed to 'configure'
	* New module rlm_ippool, to do server-side IP pooling.
	* Fix rlm_eap module for portability, to work on non-x86 platforms.
	* Re-connect to the LDAP server if the connection idles out
	* Increased the visibility of the warning messages when doing
	  'make install'
	* Fixed EAP module to use 16-bit integers, so that it will
	  work on big-endian architectures.
	
FreeRADIUS 0.5.0 ; Date: 2002/03/14 22:18:22, urgency=medium

		http://www.freeradius.org/cvs-log/
	* Added Foundry dictionary, from Thomas Keitel
	* Fix a logic bug in the 'walk over request list' code, which
	  would sometimes result in a request being deleted while it
	  was still being processed.  Found by Rainer Clasen
	* New 'tuning' guide, for optimizing the server's speed.
	* The default ports are now 1812/1813, which is the standard.
	* Fix a bug which would hang the server when many SQL connections
	  were open.  Found by Cvetan Ivanov <zezo@spnet.net>

	* 'xlat' capability for SQL, so other modules can do SQL queries.
	* We don't need a shared secret for LOCAL realms.
	* Added better description of internal variables.

	  want to use the DEFAULT realm, if all configured realms are
	  marked dead.  From Rainer Clasen.
	* new configuration items 'max_attributes' and 'reject_delay'
	  If the packet contains too many attributes, it can be rejected.
	  We can also delay sending an Access-Reject, which slows down
	  certain DoS attacks.
	* Updates to redhat scripts and spec file, from Marko Myllynen.
	* Python module (EXPERIMENTAL) from migs paraz <mparaz@yahoo.com>
	* Add ability to find *best* match when comparing attributes.

	  most authentication handlers in other modules.
	* Send a Access-Reject after max_request_time
	* Multiple fixes in the LDAP module.
	* Quintum dictionary by Jeremy McNamara <jj@indie.org>
	* Preliminary EAP Module with MD5 support
	  Contributed by Raghu <raghud@hereuare.com>
	* Better sanity checking for bad VSA's when receiving a packet
	* new 'xlat register' so that attribute values may be pulled
	  out of configurable databases at run-time.
	  e.g. %{ldap:ldap:///dc=company,dc=com?uid?sub?uid=%u}
	* Minor fixes to debian package rules
	* Attribute 'Password' deprecated in favor of 'User-Password'.

FreeRADIUS 0.4.0 ; urgency=low

	* Allow the MS-CHAP module to work, and to read /etc/smbpass
	  3APA3A <3APA3A@SECURITY.NNOV.RU>
	* Remove the server requirement that one of User-Password
	  or CHAP-Password exist when doing authentication.  These
	  checks should be handled by the modules.  This change
	  also prepares us for EAP.
	  Patch from Raghu <raghud@hereuare.com>
	* Make NAS-Port-ID in radwho, raduse, etc. unsigned,
	  instead of signed.
	  Patch from John Morrissey <jwm@horde.net>
	* Allow \t and \n inside of configuration strings.
	  Frank Cusack <fcusack@fcusack.com>
	* X9.9 Challenge-Response token card support.
	  For now, only CRYPTOCard tokens are supported.
	  Frank Cusack <fcusack@fcusack.com>
	* Fix core dump on Solaris in radwho.c
	  Patch from Eddie Stassen <eddies@saix.net>
	* Fix leak / core dump in Oracle module.
	* Fix memory leak in rlm_counter
	  Kostas Kalevras <kkalev@noc.ntua.gr>
	* "LOCAL" realms do not need to have an entry in the 'clients'
	  file.  Philippe Levan <levan@epix.net>

FreeRADIUS 0.3.0 ; urgency=low

	* Added ability to send debug messages to the log file, when
	  running in daemon mode.
	* Miscellaneous fixes to get Debian packaging working.
	* When trapping a signal, don't SIGKILL children on a SIGTERM,
	  SIGTERM them, instead.  This allows Exec-Program scripts to
	  catch the signal, and finish processing, instead of dying.
	  Bug noted by Michael Chernyakhovsky <magmike@mail.ru>
	* Increased limit on length of user name read from /etc/passwd,
	  to match the maximum allowed by RADIUS.
	  Bug noted by "Gonzalez B., Fernando" <fgonzalez@manquehue.cl>
	* Configurable fail-over when proxying packets.  If the
	  home server doesn't respond to a repeated proxied request,
	  it's marked as 'dead', and the next one in the list is used.
	  Patch by Eddie Stassen <eddies@saix.net> and <spirn@21cn.com>
	* Pass Access-Challenge attributes through the server, in
	  preparation for EAP.
	  Raghu <raghud@hereuare.com>
	* More fixes for RFC compliance on the Message-Authenticator
	  Raghu <raghud@hereuare.com>
	* Merged OSFC2/OSFSIA authentication patches from Cistron.
	  (Bug # 104)  The patches are not well tested, however.
	* IBM DB2 UDB V7.1 SQL driver, contributed by
	  Joerg Wendland <wendland@scan-plus.de>
	* Fix the IP + Port address assignment.
	  Bug found by "John Padula" <john_padula@aviancommunications.com>
	* Patch to avoid smashing the contents of Ascend binary filters.
	  Michael Chernyakhovsky <magmike@mail.ru>
	* Create and Validate Message-Authenticator attribute, in
	  preparation for EAP.
	* Initialize variables properly in rlm_attr_filter.
	  Patch from Andriy I Pilipenko <bamby@marka.net.ua>
	* Renamed RedHat init script from 'radiusd.init' to 'radiusd'.
	  This allows it to work properly with the RedHat rc system.
	  Patch from Christian Vogel <chris@amor.iksys.de>
	* Fix the configure script checks for PostgreSQL, so that
	  they use the 'test' command properly.
	  Bug found by Robert Haskins <rhaskins@ziplink.net>
	* Change instances of 'assert' to 'rad_assert', so that it
	  can log the error to the standard radius log files.
	  Patch from Vesselin Atanasov <vesselin@bgnet.bg>
	* Patch to prevent segv when freeing results, from
	  Tomas Heredia <tomas@intermediasp.com>
	* Added support for Exec-Program to acct.  Bug found by
	  <magmike@mail.ru>
	* Corrected rlm_files so that raddb/acct_users works
        * When doing synchronous proxying, update proxy next try
	  entries, so that the server doesn't eat CPU time.
	  Raghu <raghud@hereuare.com>
	* Add primitive dictionary.nomadix <CBoyd@apogeetelecom.com>
	* Log messages to console, if the logger hasn't been
	  initialized.  <vesselin@bgnet.bg>
	* Log invalid user for proxy rejects, too. <help@visp.net>
	* Fixed Expiration attribute handling.
	* Added code to handle Ascend-Send-Secret and Ascend-Receive-Secret
	* Removed non thread-pool code.  If we have threads, we now force
	  the use of thread pools.
	* Update version number
	* correct bug where proxied accounting packets would never have a
	  reply sent back to the NAS, or the reply would be sent twice.

FreeRADIUS Alpha 0.2.0, July 30, 2001.

	* call openlog() again when using PAM, to get the correct log
	facility.
	* Update child thread code, to minimize race conditions.
	* Make thread pools the default.  Using plain child threads is NOT
	recommended.
	* Ignore SIGPIPE to get ride of crashes when using ldap.
	* Update proxying code to work better.
	* Platform independent pthread_cancel()ling
	* Fix 'unresponsive child pid' erroneous warning messages.
	* Many changes to get various SQL modules working.
	Note that there may still be some issues with Oracle.
	* Added configure options 'with-rlm-FOO-include/lib-dir', so that
	lower-level rlm_FOO modules can be configured via the top-level
	configuration file.  This isn't completely done yet.
	* Fix check for shared library using libtool info, instead of
	assuming extension being ".so".
	* Fixes for HPUX.  We probably need more.
	* Many additional bug fixes and changes.

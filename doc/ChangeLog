	* Massive fixes for Debian packaging.
	* radclient can now send "disconnect" packets, to NASes which
	  support it.  The server, however, CANNOT send disconnect packets.

	  we are looking for the NULL entry and it doesn't exist. Bug
	  noted by Nathan Miller.
	* Disable child process spawning if we don't have threads.
	  The code doesn't work, so it's better to force the server
	  to run in single-process mode.
	* New rlm_exec module, which allows a more generic way of
	  executing external programs.
	* Preliminary large file support in 'configure' and in the server,
	  to support 2G+ detail files.

	  via SIGTERM.
	* Removed all need for the old-style 'naslist' and 'client' files,
	  and noted that they are deprecated.
	* Added support for Status-Server packets, stolen shamelessly

	  things are wrong.
	* Bug fixes to rlm_dbm.
	* Updates for checkrad, max40xx routine, from Aleksandr Kuzminsky.
	* Disable caching of passwords for the Unix module.  It was

	* radwho and radzap now read 'radiusd.conf' to discover where the
	  radutmp files are located.  Patch from Andrea Gabellini.
	* Preliminary 'expression' module, to allow you to do cool things
	  like:    Session-Timeout = `%{expr:3600 - %{sql:SELECT ...}}`
	* Added ability to do xlat on check items, and reply items,
	  so that the value of the reply attributes can be dynamically
	  generated.
	* Added MIBs, taken from the RFC's.  This makes SNMP queries to
	  the server a little easier to set up.
	* Don't SEGV when we receive a packet which is larger than the
	  size claimed in the RADIUS portion.  Patch from Vaughn Skinner.
	* SNMP patches from Harrie Hazewinkel.

	  with only an 'xlat' function can be registered.
	* Allow '{' and '}' in xlat'd strings.
	* C++ compatibility patch from Andrey Kotrekhov, for libradius.
	* Automatically decrypt/encrypt User-Password, so that debugging
	  mode will print out the text password, and not the random
	  garbage it previously showed.
	* Cleaned up header files and function prototypes for the SQL
	  sub-modules.
	
FreeRADIUS 0.7 ; Date: 2002/07/26 18:01:50 , urgency=high

	* Added experimental SMB authentication module, which uses
	  PAP passwords to authenticate against an NT-Domain.
	  NT/LM-passwords are not currently supported.
	* More documentation for rlm_passwd, rlm_mschap, and rlm_digest.
	* 'configure' changes to better find sem_init and friends.
	* Allow the use of previously installed libtool, and libltdl.
	  This appears to help a lot on FreeBSD.

	  CallBack-Number = `%{request:Calling-Station-Id}`
	  sets the value of the CallBack-Number attribute to the value of
	  the Calling-Station-Id in the original request.
	* Cute hack: Allow regex matching on IP addresses, by placing
	  the string representation of the IP address (1.2.3.4) into
	  the internal data structure.  This allows things like
	  NAS-IP-Address =~ "^192\.168", which may be useful.
	* Add documentation for experimental rlm_dbm module.
	* Added experimental Perl module.
	* Added the relevant IETF RFC's (standards documents) to 'doc/rfc',
	  along with some simple perl scripts to convert them to cross-
	  referenced HTML.
	* Updated the experimental Python module.
	* Added Cisco SSG VSA's
	* When rejecting authentication due to external Exec-Program, do
	  NOT free the reply pairs, as the server core will take care of
	  doing that.  Bug noted by Thomas Jalsovsky
	* New experimental module: rlm_cram
	  Supports APOP, CRAM-MD5, CRAM-MD4, CRAM-SHA1 with it's own
	  VSA's. This module may be used for SMTP/POP3/IMAP4 server

	* Sybase driver from mattias@nogui.se.
	* Modules are now versioned.
	* Delete garbage Proxy-Reply attributes sent by the home server
	  before performing our own reply.

	  different auth/acct servers for the same realms.
	  Patch from Eddie Stassen.
	* Minor updates to encrypted tunnel passwords.
	* Default 'run_dir' is now /var/run/radiusd, not var/run.
	  /var/run is writeable only by root, and radiusd may be run suid.
	* Modules are now versioned, so that upgrading the server
	  ensures that the new modules are installed.
	* Fix sql code, so that magic SQL characters don't get the
	  SQL server excited.
	* Remove references to "UNKNOWN-NAS" in log messages.
	* Properly handle fork() and obtaining child processes exit
	  status when using threads.  (pthread is broken w.r.t. signals)

	* Implemented Digest authentication, as per IETF document
	  draft-sterman-aaa-sip-00.txt, to perform authentication against
	  a Cisco SIP server.
	* If no password or group files have been specified in the config,
	  use the standard system calls to find them, rather than giving
	  up.  Patch from Steve Langasek.	
	* Return Proxy-State attributes in a delated Access-Reject
	* Corrected 'session zap' logic, when an old and unused session
	  is deleted from the databases.  Accounting packets with garbage
	  Client-IP-Address attributes should no longer be a problem.
	* Bug fixed in LDAP attribute map, for MS-CHAP related attributes.
	* Fixes to the EAP module to work better with XP.
	* Support for MS-SQL, using the FreeTDS library,
	  from Dmitri Ageev
	* New operators =* and !*.  See 'man 5 users' for details.
	* Added translation for %{config:section.subsection.item}, to
	  allow run-time translation of internal configuration parameters.
	* New rlm_sqlcounter module, to keep counters based on SQL data.
	* Fix rlm_realm, to allow seperate proxying of accounting and
	  authentication requests.
	* Bug fixes in PostgreSQL back-end, from Andrew Kukhta.
	* Increase internal buffers, to allow large SQL query strings.
	* Added debug level 3 (-xxx), where debug messages have time stamps.
	* Fix 'radwho' to use the correct radutmp file, as found by
	  'configure' (but radwho still doesn't read radiusd.conf)
	* Fix bugs in tunnel (tagged attribute) code, which would prevent
	  tagged attributes from being generated correctly in a packet.
	* Build only 'stable' modules by default.  Experimental modules
	  require --with-experimental-modules to be passed to 'configure'
	* New module rlm_ippool, to do server-side IP pooling.

	* Re-connect to the LDAP server if the connection idles out
	* Increased the visibility of the warning messages when doing
	  'make install'

	* New 'tuning' guide, for optimizing the server's speed.
	* The default ports are now 1812/1813, which is the standard.
	* Fix a bug which would hang the server when many SQL connections

	* 'xlat' capability for SQL, so other modules can do SQL queries.
	* We don't need a shared secret for LOCAL realms.
	* Added better description of internal variables.
	* Configurable fail-over to DEFAULT realm.  Sometimes we don't
	  want to use the DEFAULT realm, if all configured realms are
	  marked dead.  From Rainer Clasen.
	* new configuration items 'max_attributes' and 'reject_delay'
	  If the packet contains too many attributes, it can be rejected.
	  We can also delay sending an Access-Reject, which slows down
	  certain DoS attacks.
	* Updates to redhat scripts and spec file, from Marko Myllynen.
	* Python module (EXPERIMENTAL) from migs paraz <mparaz@yahoo.com>
	* Add ability to find *best* match when comparing attributes.

	* Preliminary EAP Module with MD5 support
	  Contributed by Raghu <raghud@hereuare.com>
	* Better sanity checking for bad VSA's when receiving a packet
	* new 'xlat register' so that attribute values may be pulled
	  out of configurable databases at run-time.
	  e.g. %{ldap:ldap:///dc=company,dc=com?uid?sub?uid=%u}
	* Minor fixes to debian package rules
	* Attribute 'Password' deprecated in favor of 'User-Password'.
	* MS-CHAP and MS-CHAPv2 MPPE support added.
	  Contributed by Takahiro Wagatsuma <waga@sic.shibaura-it.ac.jp>.

	  checks should be handled by the modules.  This change
	  also prepares us for EAP.
	  Patch from Raghu <raghud@hereuare.com>
	* Make NAS-Port-ID in radwho, raduse, etc. unsigned,
	  instead of signed.

	* Increased limit on length of user name read from /etc/passwd,
	  to match the maximum allowed by RADIUS.
	  Bug noted by "Gonzalez B., Fernando" <fgonzalez@manquehue.cl>

	facility.
	* Update child thread code, to minimize race conditions.
	* Make thread pools the default.  Using plain child threads is NOT
	recommended.
	* Ignore SIGPIPE to get ride of crashes when using ldap.
	* Update proxying code to work better.
	* Platform independent pthread_cancel()ling
	* Fix 'unresponsive child pid' erroneous warning messages.
	* Many changes to get various SQL modules working.
	Note that there may still be some issues with Oracle.
	* Added configure options 'with-rlm-FOO-include/lib-dir', so that
	lower-level rlm_FOO modules can be configured via the top-level
	configuration file.  This isn't completely done yet.
	* Fix check for shared library using libtool info, instead of
	assuming extension being ".so".
	* Fixes for HPUX.  We probably need more.
	* Many additional bug fixes and changes.

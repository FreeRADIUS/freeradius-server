FreeRADIUS 3.0.0 Mon 01 Jan 8:00:00 CEST 2010, urgency=medium
	Feature improvements
	* Largely configuration file compatible with 2.1.x.
	* Documentation for upgrading from 2.x is in raddb/README.rst
	  Please follow it.  Do not just install 3.0.
	* Updated packet encode/decoder.  The resulting code is much
	  simpler and easier to extend.
	* Updated internal API to support new attributes and formats
	* Added RADIUS over TLS (i.e. RadSec). See raddb/sites-available/tls
	* Added "extended attributes" using the new encoder/decoder.
	* Added the "integer64" data type.
	* Added full WiMAX support, using the new encoder/decoder.  The old
	  code could not handle some unusual corner cases.
	* Added code to send SNMP Traps.  See raddb/trigger.conf.
	* Added support for Apple's Grand Central Dispatch
	* Added for MS-CHAP Change Password from Phil Mayers.
	  See raddb/mods-available/mschap, "passchange" subsection.
	* Added provisions for raddb/dictionary.local, for local changes.
	  See raddb/dictionary for more details.
	* Added EAP-PWD implementation from Dan Harkins
	* Added packet/s tracking. See max_pps in the "listen" sections,
	  and auto_limit_acct in the "thread pool" section.
	* Moved configuration entries in radiusd.conf to make more sense.
	* Moved raddb/modules/ to raddb/mods-available, and raddb/mods-enabled,
	  following the examples of other projects.
	* Moved eap.conf to mods-available/eap
	* Moved sql.conf to mods-available/sql
	* Moved TLS configuration for EAP into a common subsection.
	  See raddb/mods-available/eap, tls-config section.

	Bug fixes
	* All known bug fixes are included.
	* Removed "addport" functionality.

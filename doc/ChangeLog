	Feature improvements
	* For upgrade instructions, see raddb/README.rst
	* "authorize", "authenticate", "preacct", etc.
	  are no longer used.
	* Dropped support for -i and -p flags in radiusd
	* New "map" function in unlang.  See "man unlang".
	* The "load-balance" and "redundant-load-balance"
	  sections now accept a key.  See "man unlang".
	* The EAP module tracks certificates in a different
	  attribute list.  See the upgrade instructions.
	* The EAP module produces much better messages
	  when using TLS.
	* The MySQL and Postgresql modules now call the
	  database string escape functions, instead of
	  using "safe_characters".
	* radsniff stats (-W) now operates on PCAP files too.
	* radsniff stats can be printed in CSV format.
	* radsniff processes .1Q tagged packets by default.
	* Redis cluster support for all Redis modules.
	* TLV Attributes can now be nested to nearly any depth.
	* radsnmp client which can listen on Net-SNMP "pass persist"
	  and translate that into queries to the server.
	* rlm_perl: radiusd::xlat to evaluate xlat string within
	  perl script
	* rlm_ldap supports maps, which can map the contents
	  of multiple LDAP objects to RADIUS attributes.
	* Both the rlm_ldap map and xlat functions support server
	  side sort control specifiers in their URLs.
	* rlm_eap supports RSA/ECC key agility.

	Bug fixes
	* Attribute names in unlang MUST be prefixed with &
	  This fixes a host of ambiguities when parsing.
	* Added unit tests for dictionary parsing and
	  restrictions on which attributes can appear where.

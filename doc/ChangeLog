FreeRADIUS 2.1.9 Wed 1 Jan 16:44:50 CEST 2011, urgency=medium
	Feature improvements
	* Add radmin command "stats detail <file>" to see what
	  is going on inside of a detail file reader.
	* Added documentation for CoA.  See raddb/sites-available/coa
	* Add sub-option support for Option 82.  See dictionary.dhcp
	* Add "server" field to default SQL NAS table, and documented it.

	Bug fixes
	* Reset "received ping" counter for Status-Server checks.  In some
	  corner cases it was not getting reset.
	* Handle large VMPS attributes.
	* Count accounting responses from a home server in SNMP / statistics
	  code.
	* Set EAP-Session-Resumed = Yes, not "No" when session is resumed.
	* radmin packet counter statistics are now unsigned, for numbers
	  2^31..2^32.  After that they roll over to zero.
	* Be more careful about expanding data in PAP and MS-CHAP modules.
	  This prevents login failures when passwords contain '{'.
	* Clean up zombie children if there were many "exec" modules being
	  run for one packet, all with "wait = no".
	* re-open log file after HUP.  Closes bug #63.
	* Fix "no response to proxied packet" complaint for Coa / Disconnect
	  packets.  It shouldn't ignore replies to packets it sent.
	* Calculate IPv6 netmasks correctly.  Closes bug #69.
	* Fix SQL module to re-open sockets if they unexpectedly close.
	* Track scope for IPv6 addresses.  This lets us use link-local
	  addresses properly.  Closes bug #70.
	* Updated Makefiles to no longer use the shell for recursing into
	  subdirs.  "make -j 2" should now work.
	* Updated raddb/sql/mysql/ippool.conf to use "= NULL".  Closes
	  bug #75.
	* Updated Makefiles so that "make reconfig" no longer uses the shell
	  for recursing into subdirs, and re-builds all "configure" files.
	* Used above method to regenerate all configure scripts.
	  Closes bug #34.
	* Updated SQL module to allow "server" field of "nas" table
	  to be blank: "".  This means the same as it being NULL.
	* Fixed regex realm example.  Create Realm attribute with value
	  of realm from User-Name, not from regex.  Closes bug #40.
	* If processing a DHCP Discover returns "fail / reject", ignore
	  the packet rather than sending a NAK.
	* Allow '%' to be escaped in sqlcounter module.
	* Fix typo internal hash table.
	* For PEAP and TTLS, the tunneled reply is added to the reply,
	  rather than integrated via the operators.  This allows multiple
	  VSAs to be added, where they would previously be discarded.
	* Make request number unsigned.  This changes nothing other than
	  the debug output when the server receives more than 2^31 packets.
	* Don't block when reading child output in 'exec wait'.  This means
	  that blocked children get killed, instead of blocking the server.
	* Enabled building without any proxy functionality
	* radclient now prefers IPv4, to match the default server config.
	* Print useful error when a realm regex is invalid
	* relaxed rules for preprocess module "with_cisco_vsa_hack".  The
	  attributes can now be integer, ipaddr, etc.  (i.e. non-string)
	* Allow rlm_ldap to build if ldap_set_rebind_proc() has only
	  2 arguments.
	* Update configure script for rlm_python to avoid dynamic linking
	  problems on some platforms.
	* Work-around for bug #35
	* Do suid to "user" when running in debug mode as root
	* Make "allow_core_dumps" work in more situations.
	* In detail file reader, treat bad records as EOF.
	  This allows it to continue working when the disk is full.
	* Fix Oracle default accounting queries to work when there are no
	  gigawords attributes.  Other databases already had the fix.
	* Fix rlm_sql to show when it opens and closes sockets.  It already
	  sayswhen it cannot connect, so it should say when it can connect.

FreeRADIUS 2.1.8 Wed 30 Dec 16:44:50 CEST 2009, urgency=medium
	Feature improvements
	* Print more descriptive error message for too many EAP sessions.
	  This gives hints on what to do when "failed to store handler"
	* Commands received from radmin are now printed on stdout when
	  in debugging mode.
	* Allow accounting packets to be written to a detail file, even
	  if they were read from a different detail file.
	* Added OpenSSL license exception (src/LICENSE.openssl)

	Bug fixes
	* DHCP sockets can now set the broadcast flag before binding to a
	  socket.  You need to set "broadcast = yes" in the DHCP listener.
	* Be more restrictive on string parsing in the config files
	* Fix password length in scripts/create-users.pl
	* Be more flexible about parsing the detail file.  This allows
	  it to read files where the attributes have been edited.
	* Ensure that requests read from the detail file are cleaned up
	  (i.e. don't leak) if they are proxied without a response.
	* Write the PID file after opening sockets, not before
	  (closes bug #29)
	* Proxying large numbers of packets no longer gives error
	  "unable to open proxy socket".
	* Avoid mutex locks in libc after fork
	* Retry packet from detail file if there was no response.
	* Allow old-style dictionary formats, where the vendor name is the
	  last field in an ATTRIBUTE definition.
	* Removed all recursive use of mutexes.  Some systems just don't
	  support this.
	* Allow !* to work as documented.
	* make templates work (see templates.conf)
	* Enabled "allow_core_dumps" to work again
	* Print better errors when reading invalid dictionaries
	* Sign client certificates with CA, rather than server certs.
	* Fix potential crash in rlm_passwd when file was closed
	* Fixed corner cases in conditional dynamic expansion.
	* Use InnoDB for MySQL IP Pools, to gain transactional support
	* Apply patch to libltdl for CVE-2009-3736.
	* Fixed a few issues found by LLVM's static checker
	* Keep track of "bad authenticators" for accounting packets
	* Keep track of "dropped packets" for auth/acct packets
	* Synced the "debian" directory with upstream
	* Made "unlang" use unsigned 32-bit integers, to match the
	  dictionaries.

	* Made thread pool section optional.  If it doesn't exist,
	  the server will run single-threaded.
	* Added sample radrelay.conf for people upgrading from 1.x
	* Made proxying more stable by failing over, rather than
	  rejecting the first request.  See "response_window" in proxy.conf

	* Fixes to ruby module to be more careful about when it builds.
	* Updated Perl module "configure" script to check for broken
	  Perl installations.
	* Fix "status_check = none".  It would still send packets
	  in some cases.
	* Set recursive flag on the proxy mutex, which enables safer
	  cleanup on some platforms.
	* Copy the EAP username verbatim, rather than escaping it.
	* Update handling so that robust-proxy-accounting works when
	  all home servers are down for extended periods of time.
	* Look for DHCP option 53 anywhere in the packet, not just

	* Make %l work
	* Fix pthread keys in rlm_perl
	* Log reasons for EAP failure (closes bug #8)
	* Load home servers and pools that aren't referenced from a realm.
	* Handle return codes from virtual attributes in "unlang"

	  versions of OpenLDAP.
	* Check value of Fall-Through in attr_filter module.

FreeRADIUS 2.1.6 Mon May 18 10:00:00 CEST 2009;   urgency=medium

	* Added configurable "retry_interval" and "poll_interval"
	  for "detail" listeners.
	* Added "delete_mppe_keys" configuration option to rlm_wimax.
	  Apparently some WiMAX clients misbehave when they see those keys.
	* Added experimental rlm_ruby from
	  http://github.com/Antti/freeradius-server/tree/master
	* Add Tunnel attributes to ldap.attrmap
	* Enable virtual servers to be reloaded on HUP.  For now, only
	  the "authorize", "authenticate", etc. processing sections are
	  reloaded.  Clients and "listen" sections are NOT reloaded.
	* Updated "radwatch" script to be more robust.  See scripts/radwatch
	* Added certificate compatibility notes in raddb/certs/README,
	  for compatibility with different operating systems. (i.e. Windows)

	* Minor fixes from John Center
	* Fixed raddebug example
	* Don't crash when deleting attributes via unlang
	* Be friendlier to very fast clients
	* Updated the "detail" listener so that it only polls once,

	* Update comparison for Packet-Src-IP-Address (etc.) so that
	  the operators other than '==' work.
	* Did autoconf magic to work around weird libtool bug
	* Make rlm_perl keep tags for tagged attributes in more situations
	* Update UID checking for radmin
	* Added "include_length" field for TTLS.  It's needed for RFC

	  create control sockets owned by root.
	* Fixed more minor issues found by Coverity.
	* Allow raddb/certs/bootstrap to run when there is no "make"
	  command installed.
	* In radiusd.conf, run_dir depends on the name of the program,
	  and isn't hard-coded to "..../radiusd"
	* Check for EOF in more places in the "detail" file reader.
	* Added Freeswitch dictionary.
	* Chop ethernet frames in VMPS, rather than droppping packets.
	* Fix EAP-TLS bug.  Patch from Arnaud Ebalard

	  platforms.
	* Correct internal handling of "debug condition" to prevent it
	  from being over-written.
	* Check return code of regcomp in "unlang", so that invalid
	  regular expressions are caught rather than mishandled.
	* Make rlm_sql use <ltdl.h>.  Addresses bug #610.
	* Document list "type = status" better.  Closes bug #580.

	  can go to the log file, and not stdout.
	* Added dictionary.rfc5176
	* EAP module now checks for instance name, and uses that for
	  authentication.  This avoids the need to set Auth-Type when
	  there are multiple instances of the EAP module.
	* Added Module-Return-Code attribute, which contains the value
	  returned by the previous module (ok/fail/update/etc.)

	Bug fixes
	* Corrected typos in rlm_dbm.  Closes bugs #521 and #522.
	* Detail file "listen" sections now work much better.

	  This is available only debug builds.  It can be used
	  to create invalid packets! Use it with care.
	* Permit "unlang" policies inside of Auth-Type{} sub-sections
	  of the authenticate{} section.  This makes some policies easier
	  to implement.
	* "listen" sections can now have "type = proxy".  This lets you
	  control which IP is used for sending proxied requests.
	* Added note on SSL performance to raddb/certs/README

	Bug fixes
	* Fixed reading of "detail" files.
	* Allow inner EAP tunneled sessions to be proxied.
	* Corrected MySQL schemas
	* syslog now works in log{} section.
	* Corrected typo in raddb/certs/client.cnf
	* Updated raddb/sites-available/proxy-inner-tunnel to
	  permit authentication to work.
	* Ignore zero-length attributes in received packets.
	* Correct memcpy when dealing with unknown attributes.
	* Corrected debugging messages in attr_rewrite.
	* Corrected generation of State attribute in EAP.  This
	  fixes the "failed to remember handler" issues.
	* Fall back to DEFAULT realm if no realm was found.
	  Based on a patch from Vincent Magnin.
	* Updated example raddb/sites-available/proxy-inner-tunnel
	* Corrected behavior of attr_filter to match documentation.
	  This is NOT backwards compatible with previous versions!
	  See "man rlm_attr_filter" for details.

FreeRADIUS 2.0.1 ; Date: 2008/01/22 13:29:37  , urgency=low
	Feature improvements
	* "unlang" has been expanded to do less run-time expansion,
	  and to have better handling of typed data.  See "man unlang"
	  for documentation and new examples.
	
	Bug fixes
	* The 'acct_unique' module has been updated to understand
	  the deprecated (but still used) Client-IP-Address attribute.
	* The EAP-MSCHAPv2 module no longer leaks MS-CHAP2-Success in
	  packets.
	* Fixed crash in rlm_dbm.
	* Fixed parsing of syslog configuration.

FreeRADIUS 2.0.0 ; Date: 2007/11/24 08:33:09 , urgency=low
	Feature improvements
	* Debugging mode is much clearer and easier to read.
        * A new policy language makes many configurations trivial.
	  See "man unlang" for a complete description.
	* Virtual servers are now supported.  This permits clear separation
	  of policies.  See raddb/sites-available/README
	* EAP-TLS (PEAP, EAP-TTLS) and OpenSSL certificates "just work".
	  See raddb/certs/README for details.
	* Proxying is much more configurable than before.
	  See proxy.conf for documentation on pools, and new config items.
	* Full support for IPv6.
	* Much more complete support for the RADIUS SNMP MIBs.
	* HUP now works.  Only some modules are re-loaded,
	  and the server configuation is *not* reloaded.
	* "check config" option now works.  See "man radiusd"
	* radrelay functionality is now included in the server core.
	  See raddb/sites-available/copy-acct-to-home-server
	* VMPS support.  It is minimal, but functional.
	* Cleaned up internal API's and names, including library names.
	
	Bug fixes
	* Many.

FreeRADIUS 3.0.1 Mon  7 Oct 2013 15:48:14 EDT urgency=medium
	Feature improvements
	* Add "timeout" to exec, and "ntlm_auth_timeout" to mschap.
	  So that run-away child processes are caught earlier.
	* Allow TLS clients to use "proto = tls", in which case
	  TLS is required.  The shared secret is then set to "radsec".
	* More documentation in the tls virtual server.
	* Add "date" module for date formatting.
	  See raddb/mods-available/date.
	* Added unit test suite for internal server functionality
	* When loading "update" sections, check if the RHS is a literal
	  value.  If so, syntax check it immediately.
	* Update LDAP module documentation and functionality.
	  The generic attribute can now update lists.
	* Updated dictionary.extreme.
	* Update sqlippool to do clears as a separate transaction,
	  and at most once per second.  This should help MySQL.
	* Respect control:Response-Packet-Type for all types of
	  requests.
	* Add support for SSL encryption to the MySQL driver.
	* Allow arbitrary connection parameters to be used with the
	  PostgreSQL driver.

	Bug fixes
	* Use correct field for ARP setting in DHCP.
	* Fix crash on debug condition (#454).
	* Fix a number of minor issues caught by the clang
	  analyzer.
	* Set WARNING messages to yellow instead of normal text.
	* Correct debug colorise logic.  Patch from Phil Mayers.
	* Encode attributes of type "ethernet".  No one uses them,
	  but it makes sense.
	* Work around regex initialization issues.
	* Fix build when linking against OpenSSL.
	* Print IDs as positive numbers, which helps for large DHCP
	  XIDs.
	* Fix issue with sql_ippool.
	* sqlcounter now uses 64-bit counters, to deal with 4G overflow.
	* Fix issues with DHCP subsystem.
	* Don't build / install disabled modules, or their config
	  files.
	* Fix build for OSX Mavericks, which hid the header files
	  in a magical place.
	* Fix LEAP buffer issue.  You should still avoid LEAP.
	* Mark "unknown" WiMAX attributes as being WiMAX.
	* Fix typo in packet decoder for fragmented extended attrs
	* RPM spec fixes.
	* Always run unit tests before building radiusd.
	* Fix rlm_perl build issues when not using threads.
	* Enable %{Response-Packet-Type} again.
	* Update configuration file parser to handle "bool"
	  consistently.
	* Make more messages debug instead of info, to avoid
	  polluting the logs with messages that can't be fixed.
	* Set operator in internal unlang code to suppress spurious
	  warning messages.
	* Fix debian packaging.
	* Added "status" to Debian init script.
	* Fix "update outer.request" to update the outer request.
	* Don't print TLS debugging messages when not in debug mode.
	* Correctly manage counters for "limit" sections of TCP / TLS
	  "listen" sockets.
	* Fix libldap debug output.
	* Fix rlm_ldap tls functionality.
	* Initialise OpenSSL globals early to avoid issues with the
	  PostgreSQL library.
	* Fix typo in sqlcounter expansion code.  Fixes #463
	* Overwrite previous instances of SQL-User-Name when adding
	  it to the request.

FreeRADIUS 3.0.0 Mon  7 Oct 2013 15:48:14 EDT urgency=medium
	Feature improvements
	* Documentation for upgrading from 2.x is in raddb/README.rst
	  Please follow it.  It will make the upgrade easier.
	* Moved configuration entries in radiusd.conf to make more sense.
	* Added the "integer64" and "ipv4prefix" data types.
	* Added RADIUS over TLS (i.e. RadSec). See raddb/sites-available/tls
	* Updated internal API to support new attributes and formats
	* Added code to send SNMP Traps.  See raddb/trigger.conf.
	* Added preliminary support for Apple's Grand Central Dispatch
	* Added provisions for raddb/dictionary.local, for local changes.
	  See raddb/dictionary for more details.
	* Added packet/s tracking. See max_pps in the "listen" section.
	* The %{} expansions and "unlang" conditions are now parsed at server
	  start. Descriptive errors are produced for syntax and format errors.
	* Casting is now supported for "unlang" comparisons.  See "man unlang"
	  e.g. <ipaddr>127.0.0.1 == Framed-IP-Address.
	* Direct comparison of attribute references is now supported.
	  e.g. &Foo == &Bar.  This avoids stringification of the attributes.
	* Direct assignment of attributes is now supported.
	  e.g. Foo := &Bar.  It also works for "octets" data types.
	* Comparisons of IPv4 and IPv6 prefixes are now supported.
	  The "<" operator means "within the prefix" for comparisons.
	* New sha1 xlat expansion (thanks to Alan Buxey)
	* Colourised log messages when logging to stdout.  Look for yellow
	  warnings and red errors.  Doing this will save you a LOT of grief.
	* If the PCRE library is available, use it (insted of the POSIX
	  functions) to process regular expressions (thanks to Phil Mayers).
	* -xv now displays all the features the server was built with, and
	  the versions of the core libraries (libtalloc, libssl).

	Module Changes
	* Moved raddb/modules/ to raddb/mods-available/, and raddb/mods-enabled/,
	  following the examples of other projects.
	* Additional files for each module are now in raddb/mods-config/.
	  See raddb/mods-config/README.rst for documentation.
	* Moved "users" to raddb/mods-config/files/authorize
	* Moved "hints" and "huntgroups" to raddb/mods-config/preprocess/
	* Moved eap.conf to mods-available/eap
	* Moved sql.conf to mods-available/sql
	* Moved TLS configuration for EAP into a common subsection.
	  See raddb/mods-available/eap, "tls-config" section.
	* Added for MS-CHAP Change Password from Phil Mayers.
	  See raddb/mods-available/mschap, "passchange" subsection.
	* Added EAP-PWD implementation from Dan Harkins
	* Added connection pools for modules. This unifies connection
	  management which was previously different for different modules.
	* SQL now uses the connection pool.  See mods-available/sql
	* SQL now supports arbitrary Acct-Status-Types.
	  These changes are not compatible with 2.x.
	* SQL now has full support for SQLite.  See raddb/sql/main/sqlite/
	* SQLite supports auto-creation of new databases on server startup for
	  bootstrapping purposes.
	* LDAP now uses the connection pool.  The LDAP module has been
	  completely re-written for performance and simplicity.
	* LDAP now caches groups.  This makes multiple group checks MUCH
	  faster.
	* Removed all limitations on 253 octet attributes.  RFC 6929 allows
	  for attributes up to 4K in length.
	* New rlm_idn module providing an expansion for performing IDNA encoding
	of internationalized domain names.  Thanks to 'skids'.
	* New rlm_yubikey module to validate yubikey OTP tokens.
	  See raddb/modules/yubikey

	Bug fixes
	* All known bug fixes from 2.2.x are included.
	* Removed "addport" functionality.
	* Removed many unused or duplicate modules.  See raddb/README.rst.

	Internal / API changes:
	* All traces of the old build system have been removed.
	  The new build system is faster and simpler.
	* clang is fully supported.
	* We now use "talloc" for memory management.  A number of new
	  features required this change.  Thanks to the Samba people!
	* Many internal APIs have been updated to use talloc.
	* New API for iterating over VALUE_PAIRs.  This is in preparation
	  for attributes, in version 3.1.
	* No new code should directly modify any field of a VALUE_PAIR.
	* VALUE_PAIRs contain pointers to DICT_ATTR instead of containing
	  attribute and vendor fields.  This will allow nested attributes.
	* Some protocol specific code has been moved out into proto_* modules.
	  More will come in subsequent versions.  See proto_dhcp and proto_vmps.
	* Standardised internal logging macros.  radlog() should not be used.
	  See src/include/log.h
	* Use OpenSSL hashing functions when available.
	* The server now builds with no warnings on most platforms.
	* New RADIUS encoder/decoder, to support new formats.
	* Added RFC 6929 "extended attributes", via the new encoder/decoder.
	* Added full WiMAX support, via the new encoder/decoder.  The old
	  code could not handle some unusual corner cases.

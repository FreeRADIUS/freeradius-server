FreeRADIUS 2.2.1 Mon 10 Sep 2012 12:00:00 CEST, urgency=medium
	Feature improvements
	* Updated dictionary.alcatel, dictionary.bskyb, dictionary.proxim,
	  dictionary.zeus
	* Added %{randstr:..} support. Creates random strings in a
	  controllable format.
	* Added operator support to rlm_python
	* Added %{hex:...} for hex version of raw attribute data
	* Added %{base64:...} for raw attribute data (e.g. 32-bit IP addr),
	  and %{tobase64:...} for the printable string form (e.g. 1.2.3.4),
	  and %{base64tohex:...} to convert a base64 string to a hex string.
	* Use correct terminology when printing errors regarding request/
	  response/message authenticators.
	* Added keytab support to Heimdal Kerberos. Patch from Ryan Steinmetz.
	* radsqlrelay does multiple INSERTs in one transaction.
	  Patch from Uwe Meyer-Gruhl.
	* Run Post-Proxy-Type Reject {} if the upstream server rejected the
	  request.
	* On startup, the server checks if it was linked with the correct
	  OpenSSL libraries.  if not, it errors out.  This prevents later
	  crashes in OpenSSL, due to library incompatibilities.
	* Added radmin command "hup main.log", to re-open the log files,
	  without HUPing any other part of the server.
	* Added support for EAP-Key-Name.  See raddb/sites-available/default,
	  and look for comments mentioning EAP-Key-Name.  MacSec now works.
	* Added support for hex numbers (0x...) to %{expr: ...}

	Bug fixes
	* Skip OCSP if there's no host / port / url, with soft_fail
	* Properly decode AT_IDENTITY in EAP-SIM.  Patch from Iliya Peregoudov
	* Thread max_queue_size has better bounds checking.
	* Use correct variable for warning message if the user misconfigures
	  the server.
	* radtest is more generous about parsing ppphint
	* radeapclient now accepts -4 and -6, just like radclient.
	  Patch from John Dennis.
	* Ignore ".rpmnew" and a bunch of other files when loading config
	  files from a directory.
	* Wait for child threads before exiting.  This prevents errors on
	  exit, but may increase exit time if databases are blocked!
	  Patch from Iliya Peregoudov.
	* Wrap rbtree calls in mutexes in rlm_cache to prevent memory
	  corruption. Patch from Phil Mayers.
	* Port fix for %{3GPP-*} expansion from master branch.
	* Fix sample certificate scripts when multiple client certs are
	  made
	* Track return code priorities across if/else/elsif in unlang.
	  Closes #107
	* In debug mode, print out DHCP options when sending a DHCP packet.
	* Fixes to the redis modules from Brian Candler
	* Print better debug message for LDAP "operations error"
	* Fix a number of minor issues as found by Coverity
	* Frees module config in order to prevent occasional crash on exit
	* Update DHCP debugging messages to make it clearer what's
	  going on.
	* Print multiple DHCP options the correct number of times in
	  debugging mode
	* On debug builds, don't dlclose() modules when '-m' is used.
	  This allows valgrind to show module symbols.
	* Don't count Status-Server packets in Access-Request statistics


FreeRADIUS 2.2.0 Mon 10 Sep 2012 12:00:00 CEST, urgency=medium
	Feature improvements
	* 100% configuration file compatible with 2.1.x.
	  The only fix needed is to disallow "hashsize=0" for rlm_passwd
	* Update Aruba, Alcatel Lucent, APC, BT, PaloAlto, Pureware,
	  Redback, and Mikrotik dictionaries
	* Switch to using SHA1 for certificate digests instead of MD5.
	  See raddb/certs/*.cnf
	* Added copyright statements to the dictionaries, so that we know
	  when people are using them.
	* Better documentation for radrelay and detail file writer.
	  See raddb/modules/radrelay and raddb/radrelay.conf
	* Added TLS-Cert-Subject-Alt-Name-Email from patch by Luke Howard
	* Added -F <file> to radwho
	* Added query timeouts to MySQL driver.  Patch from Brian De Wolf.
	* Add /etc/default/freeradius to debian package.
	  Patch from Matthew Newton
	* Finalize DHCP and DHCP relay code.  It should now work everywhere.
	  See raddb/sites-available/dhcp, src_ipaddr and src_interface.
	* DHCP capabilitiies are now compiled in by default.
	  It runs as a DHCP server ONLY when manually enabled.
	* Added one letter expansions: %G - request minute and %I request
	  ID.
	* Added script to convert ISC DHCP lease files to SQL pools.
	  See scripts/isc2ippool.pl
	* Added rlm_cache to cache arbitrary attributes.
	* Added max_use to rlm_ldap to force connection to be re-established
	  after a given number of queries.
	* Added configtest option to Debian init scripts, and automatic
	  config test on restart.
	* Added cache config item to rlm_krb5. When set to "no" ticket
	  caching is disabled which may increase performance.

	Bug fixes
	* Fix CVE-2012-3547.  All users of 2.1.10, 2.1.11, 2.1.12,
	  and 802.1X should upgrade immediately.
	* Fix typo in detail file writer, to skip writing if the packet
	  was read from this detail file.
	* Free cached replies when closing resumed SSL sessions.
	* Fix a number of issues found by Coverity.
	* Fix memory leak and race condition in the EAP-TLS session cache.
	  Thanks to Phil Mayers for tracking down OpenSSL APIs.
	* Restrict ATTRIBUTE names to character sets that make sense.
	* Fix EAP-TLS session Id length so that OpenSSL doesn't get
	  excited.
	* Fix SQL IPPool logic for non-timer attributes.  Closes bug #181
	* Change some informational messages to DEBUG rather than error.
	* Portability fixes for FreeBSD.  Closes bug #177
	* A much better fix for the _lt__PROGRAM__LTX_preloaded_symbols
	  nonsense.
	* Safely handle extremely long lines in conf file variable expansion
	* Fix for Debian bug #606450
	* Mutex lock around rlm_perl Clone routines. Patch from Eike Dehling
	* The passwd module no longer permits "hashsize = 0".  Setting that
	  is pointless for a host of reasons.  It will also break the server.
	* Fix proxied inner-tunnel packets sometimes having zero authentication
	  vector.  Found by Brian Julin.
	* Added $(EXEEXT) to Makefiles for portability.  Closes bug #188.
	* Fix minor build issue which would cause rlm_eap to be built twice.
	* When using "status_check=request" for a home server, the username
	  and password must be specified, or the server will not start.
	* EAP-SIM now calculates keys from the SIM identity, not from the
	  EAP-Identity.  Changing the EAP type via NAK may result in
	  identities changing.  Bug reported by Microsoft EAP team.
	* Use home server src_ipaddr when sending Status-Server packets
	* Decrypt encrypted ERX attributes in CoA packets.
	* Fix registration of internal xlat's so %{mschap:...} doesn't
	  disappear after a HUP.
	* Can now reference tagged attributes in expansions.
	  e.g. %{Tunnel-Type:1} and %{Tunnel-Type:1[0]} now work.
	* Correct calculation of Message-Authenticator for CoA and Disconnect
	  replies.  Patch from Jouni Malinen
	* Install rad_counter, for managing rlm_counter files.
	* Add unique index constraint to all SQL flavours so that alternate
	  queries work correctly.
	* The TTLS diameter decoder is now more lenient.  It ignores
	  unknown attributes, instead of rejecting the TTLS session.
	* Use "globfree" in detail file reader.  Prevents very slow leak.
	  Closes bug #207.
	* Operator =~ shouldn't copy the attribute, like :=.  It should
	  instead behave more like ==.
	* Build main Debian package without SQL dependencies
	* Use max_queue_size in threading code
	* Update permissions in raddb/sql/postgresql/admin.sql
	* Added OpenSSL_add_all_algorithms() to fix issues where OpenSSL
	  wouldn't use methods it knew about.
	* Add more sanity checks in dynamic_clients code so the server won't
	  crash if it attempts to load a badly formated client definition.

.SH "NAME"
radclient \- send packets to a RADIUS server, show reply
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.sp
\fBradclient\fP \fI[ OPTIONS ]\fP \fIserver {acct|auth|status|disconnect|auto} secret\fP
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
\fBradclient\fP is a radius client program. It can send arbitrary radius
packets to a radius server, then shows the reply. It can be used to test
changes you made in the configuration of the radius server, or it can be
used to monitor if a radius server is up.
.sp
\fBradclient\fP reads radius attribute/value pairs from it standard input,
or from a file specified on the command line. It then encodes these
attribute/value pairs using the dictionary, and sends them to the remote
server.
.sp
The \f(CRUser\-Password\fP and \f(CRCHAP\-Password\fP attributes are automatically
encrypted before the packet is sent to the server.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.sp
\fB\-4\fP
.RS 4
Use IPv4 (default)
.RE
.sp
\fB\-6\fP
.RS 4
Use IPv6
.RE
.sp
\fB\-b\fP
.RS 4
Enforce the Blast RADIUS checks.   All replies to an Access\-Request packet
must contain a Message\-Authenticator as the first attribute.
.sp
.if n .RS 4
.nf
.fam C
For compatibility with old servers, this flag is not set by default.
However, radclient still checks for the Blast RADIUS signature, and
discards packets which match the attack.

.sp
\fB\-c count\fP
.RS 4
Send each packet \fIcount\fP times.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-d config_dir\fP
.RS 4
The directory that contains the user dictionary file. Defaults to
\f(CR/etc/raddb\fP.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-D dict_dir\fP
.RS 4
The directory that contains the main dictionary file. Defaults to
\f(CR/usr/share/freeradius/dictionary\fP.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-f filename[:filename]\fP
.RS 4
File to read the attribute/value pairs from. If this is not specified,
they are read from stdin. This option can be specified multiple times,
in which case packets are sent in order by file, and within each file,
by first packet to last packet. A blank line separates logical packets
within a file. If a pair of files separated by a colon is specified, the
second file will be used to filter the responses to requests from the
first. The number of requests and filters must be the same. A summary of
filter results will be displayed if \-s is passed.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-F\fP
.RS 4
Print the file name, packet number and reply code.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-h\fP
.RS 4
Print usage help information.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-i id\fP
.RS 4
Use \fIid\fP as the RADIUS request Id.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-n number\fP
.RS 4
 Try to send \fInumber\fP requests per second, evenly spaced. This option
allows you to slow down the rate at which radclient sends requests. When
not using \f(CR\-n\fP, the default is to send packets as quickly as possible,
with no inter\-packet delays.
+
Due to limitations in radclient, this option does not accurately send
the requested number of packets per second.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-p number\fP
.RS 4
 Send \fInumber\fP requests in parallel, without waiting for a response
for each one. By default, radclient sends the first request it has
read, waits for the response, and once the response is received,
sends the second request in its list. This option allows you to send
many requests at simultaneously. Once \fInumber\fP are sent, radclient
waits for all of the responses to arrive (or for the requests to
time out), before sending any more packets.
+
This option permits you to discover the maximum load accepted by a
RADIUS server.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-P proto\fP
.RS 4
Use \fIproto\fP transport protocol ("tcp" or "udp"). Only available if
FreeRADIUS is compiled with TCP transport support.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-q\fP
.RS 4
Go to quiet mode, and do not print out anything.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-r number\fP
.RS 4
Try to send each packet \fInumber\fP of times as retries, before giving up on it.
The default is 10.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-s\fP
.RS 4
Print out some summaries of packets sent and received.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-S filename\fP
.RS 4
 Rather than reading the shared secret from the command\-line (where it
can be seen by others on the local system), read it instead from
\fIfilename\fP.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-t timeout\fP
.RS 4
Wait \fItimeout\fP seconds before deciding that the NAS has not responded
to a request, and re\-sending the packet. The default timeout is 3.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-v\fP
.RS 4
Print out version information.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-x\fP
.RS 4
Print out debugging information.
.RE
.sp
\fBserver[:port]\fP
.RS 4
 The hostname or IP address of the remote server. Optionally a UDP port
can be specified. If no UDP port is specified, it is looked up in
\f(CR/etc/services\fP. The service name looked for is \fBradacct\fP for accounting
packets, and \fBradius\fP for all other requests. If a service is not found
in \f(CR/etc/services\fP, 1813 and 1812 are used respectively.
+
The RADIUS attributes read by \fIradclient\fP can contain the special
attribute \f(CRPacket\-Dst\-IP\-Address\fP. If this attribute exists, then that
IP address is where the packet is sent, and the \fBserver\fP specified on
the command\-line is ignored.
+
If the RADIUS attribute list always contains the \f(CRPacket\-Dst\-IP\-Address\fP
attribute, then the \fBserver\fP parameter can be given as \fB\-\fP.
+
The RADIUS attributes read by \fIradclient\fP can contain the special
attribute \f(CRPacket\-Dst\-Port\fP. If this attribute exists, then that UDP
port is where the packet is sent, and the \fB:port\fP specified on the
command\-line is ignored.
.RE
.sp
\fBauth | acct | status | disconnect | auto\fP
.RS 4
 Use \fBauth\fP to send an authentication packet (Access\-Request), \fBacct\fP
to send an accounting packet (Accounting\-Request), \fBstatus\fP to send an
status packet (Status\-Server), or \fBdisconnect\fP to send a disconnection
request. Instead of these values, you can also use a decimal code here.
For example, code 12 is also \fBStatus\-Server\fP.
+
The RADIUS attributes read by \fIradclient\fP can contain the special
attribute \f(CRPacket\-Type\fP. If this attribute exists, then that type of
packet is sent, and the \fItype\fP specified on the command\-line is ignored.
+
If the RADIUS attribute list always contains the \f(CRPacket\-Type\fP
attribute, then the \fBtype\fP parameter can be given as \fBauto\fP.
.RE
.sp
\fBsecret\fP
.RS 4
The shared secret for this client. It needs to be defined on the
radius server side too, for the IP address you are sending the radius
packets from.
.RE
.SH "EXAMPLE"
.sp
A sample session that queries the remote server for \fIStatus\-Server\fP.
Not all servers support this, but FreeRADIUS has configurable support
for it.

.TH unlang 5 "06 December 2018" "" "FreeRADIUS Processing un-language"
.SH NAME
unlang \- FreeRADIUS Processing un\-language
.SH DESCRIPTION
FreeRADIUS supports a simple processing language in its configuration
files.  We call it an "un-language" because the intention is NOT to
create yet another programming language.  If you need something more
complicated than what is described here, we suggest using the Perl or
Python modules rlm_perl, or rlm_python.

The goal of the language is to allow simple policies to be written
with minimal effort.  Those policies are then applied when a request
is being processed.  Requests are processed through virtual servers
(including the default one), in the sections titled "recv
Access-Request", "send Access-Accept", "authenticate pap", etc.

These policies cannot be used in any other part of the configuration
files, such as module or client configuration.
.SH KEYWORDS
The keywords for the language are a combination of pre-defined
keywords, and references to loadable module names.  We document only
the pre-defined keywords here.

Subject to a few limitations described below, any keyword can appear
in any context.  The language consists of a series of entries, each
one one line.  Each entry begins with a keyword.  Entries are
organized into lists.  Processing of the language is line by line,
from the start of the list to the end.  Actions are executed
per-keyword.
.IP if
.br
Checks for a particular condition.  If true, the block after the
condition is processed.  Otherwise, the block is ignored.  See
CONDITIONS, below, for documentation on the format of the conditions.

.DS
	if (condition) {
.br
		...
.br
	}
.DE
.IP else
.br
Define a block to be executed only if the previous "if" condition
returned false.

.DS
	else {
.br
		...
.br
	}
.DE
.IP elsif
.br
Define a block to be executed only if the previous "if" condition
returned false, and if the specified condition evaluates to true.

.DS
	elsif (condition) {
.br
		...
.br
	}
.DE
.IP actions
.br
Allows for the setting of actions inside of a block.  The 'actions'
block MUST be the last block in the section.  The enclosing block MUST
be one of 'group', 'if', 'else', 'elsif', or 'case'.

See MODULE RETURN CODES, below, for a description of the actions and
their meanings.
.DS
	if (&User-Name == 'bob') {
.br
		...
.br
		actions {
.br
			ok = 1
.br
			fail = return
.br
		}
.br
	}
.DE
.IP foreach
.br
Loops over values of an attribute, running the block for each value.
The return value of the block is the return value of the last
statement executed.  The loop can be exited early by using the "break"
keyword.  No statements may appear after a "break".

Inside of the "foreach" block, the attribute which is being looped
over can be referenced as "Foreach-Variable-#".  Where "#" is the
depth of the loop, starting at "0".  e.g. "Foreach-Variable-0".  The
loops can be nested up to eight (8) deep, though this is not
recommended.

.DS
	foreach &Attribute-Reference {
.br
		...
.br
	}
.DE
.IP load-balance
This section contains a simple list of modules.  When the section is
entered, one module is chosen to process the request.  All of the
modules in the list should be the same type (e.g. ldap or sql).  All
of the modules in the list should behave identically, otherwise the
load-balance section may return different results for the same
request.

Load-balance sections can contain only a list of modules, and cannot
contain keywords that perform conditional operations (if, else, etc)
or which modify an attribute list.

Load-balance sections can optionally take a key.  The key is expanded
at run time, hashed, and the hash used to select a module.  If no
key is given, a module is chosen at random.

.DS
	load-balance &User-Name {
.br
		ldap1	# 50% of requests go here
.br
		ldap2	# 50% of requests go here
.br
	}
.DE

In general, we recommend using "redundant-load-balance" instead of
"load-balance".  The main use of the keyed load-balance sections is to
perform sharding of data across multiple back-ends, without
redundancy.  i.e. Requests will always go to one back-end, and if that
back-end is not available, the "load-balance" section will return "fail".
.IP module-name[.section-name]
A reference to the named module.  When processing reaches this point,
the pre-compiled module is called.  The module may succeed or fail,
and will return a status to "unlang" if so.  This status can be tested
in a condition.  See the "Simple Conditions" text in the CONDITIONS
section, and MODULE RETURN CODES, below.
If a section-name is provided, it will cause the module to execute
as if it were listed in the named section.

.DS
	chap  # call the CHAP module
.br
	sql   # call the SQL module
.br
	...
.DE
.IP parallel
This section runs subsections in parallel.  Each subsection runs as a
child request, which is a clone of the parent request.  Policies in
the child can modify the original parent request by referencing
"parent.request", or "parent.reply".

The child requests are required because each subsection is run
simultaneously.  If each subsection modified xthe original request at
the same time, it would be impossible to separate the state of each
subsection.

Empty child requests can be created by using "parallel empty { ... }"
Attributes must then be manually copied from the parent to the child.

Detached child requests can be created by using "parallel detach
{ ... }".  These child requests are identical copies of the parent.
The child requests will run until they are finished.

The return code of the parallel section is the same as if each
subsection was run sequentially.

.DS
	parallel {
.br
		home_server_1
.br
		home_server_2
.br
		...
.br
	}
.DE
.IP redundant
This section contains a simple list of modules.  The first module is
called when the section is being processed.  If the first module
succeeds in its operation, then the server stops processing the
section, and returns to the parent section.

If, however, the module fails, then the next module in the list is
tried, as described above.  The processing continues until one module
succeeds, or until the list has been exhausted.

Redundant sections can contain only a list of modules, and cannot
contain keywords that perform conditional operations (if, else, etc)
or modify an attribute list.

.DS
	redundant {
.br
		sql1	# try this
.br
		sql2	# try this only if sql1 fails.
.br
		...
.br
	}
.DE
.IP redundant-load-balance
This section contains a simple list of modules.  When the section is
entered, one module is chosen to process the request.  If that module
succeeds, then the server stops processing the section.  If, however,
the module fails, then one of the remaining modules is chosen at
random to process the request.  This process repeats until one module
succeeds, or until the list has been exhausted.

All of the modules in the list should be the same type (e.g. ldap or
sql).  All of the modules in the list should behave identically,
otherwise the load-balance section may return different results for
the same request.

Redundant-load-balance sections can contain only a list of modules, and cannot
contain keywords that perform conditional operations (if, else, etc)
or modify  an attribute list. Please see raddb/radiusd.conf
"instantiate" section for more configuration examples.

Redundant-load-balance sections can optionally take a key.  The key is expanded
at run time, hashed, and the hash used to select a module.  If no
key is given, a module is chosen at random.

.DS
	redundant-load-balance {
.br
		ldap1	# 50%, unless ldap2 is down, then 100%
.br
		ldap2	# 50%, unless ldap1 is down, then 100%
.br
	}
.DE

.IP return
.br
Returns from the current section, and stops all processing.  This
keyword is mainly used to avoid layers of nested "if" and "else"
statements.

.DS
	recv Access-Request {
.br
		if (...) {
.br
			...
.br
			return
.br
		}
.br
		...  # this is never reached when the "if"
.br
		...  # statement is executed
.br
	}
.DE
.IP subrequest
.br
The "subrequest" keyword creates an empty subrequest (i.e. child
request).  Attributes in the child can be copied from the parent by
referencing the "parent" list.

The packet type and protocol can be changed in a subrequest, by
changing the second parameter to the subrequest.  That parameter can
be:

* packet name, e.g. "Access-Request"
* protocol followed by packet name, e.g. "dhcpv4.Discover".

This configuration allows the server to receive one type of packet,
and then create another.  For example, the server can receive an
Accounting-Request packet, and then create a subrequest that is a
Disconnect-Request.  That subrequest can then be sent to a NAS.

The subrequest is created with no attributes.  Any attributes needed
by the subrequest should be manually copied from the parent request.

The subrequest can also be used to change protocols.  For example, the
server can receive a RADIUS Access-Request, and then create a DHCPv4
packet of type Discover.  Note that when the protocol changes,
the attributes in the "subrequest" section are parsed in the context
of the new protocol.

The original request can be accessed from inside of q "subrequest"
section.  Simple use "&parent.<ref>" to refer to an attribute in the
parent.
.DS
	subrequest <type> {
.br
		&request += {
.br
			&User-Name = &parent.request.User-Name
.br
			...
.br
		}
.br
		...
.br
	}
.DE
The purpose of a "subrequest" section is to create a child request
which can be edited independently of the parent.

The return value of the subrequest is taken from the return value of
the subsection being run.
.DE
.IP detach
.br
The "detach" keyword causes a subrequest to be detached from its
parent request.  The subrequest runs asynchronously to completion.
The subrequest immediately returns "noop" to the parent request.

The "detach" keyword can only be used inside of a "subrequest" block.
.DE
.IP switch
.br
A "switch" statement takes one argument, and contains a series of
"case" statements.  When a "switch" statement is encountered, the
argument from the "switch" is evaluated in turn against the argument
from each "case" statement.  The first "case" statement which matches
is executed.  All other "case" statements are ignored.  A default
"case" statement can be defined, by omitting its argument.

If the argument is a double quoted string (e.g. "%(exec:1 + 2)", it is
expanded as described in the DATA TYPES section, below.  The match is
then performed on the string returned from the expansion.  If the
argument is an attribute reference (e.g. &User-Name), then the match
is performed on the value of that attribute.  Otherwise, the argument
is taken to be a literal string, and and matching is done via simple
comparison.

No statement other than "case" can appear in a "switch" block.

.DS
	switch <argument> {
.br
		...
.br
	}
.DE
.IP case
.br
Provides a place-holder which matches the argument of a parent
"switch" statement.

A "case" statement cannot appear outside of a "switch" block.

If the argument is a double quoted string (e.g. "%(exec:1 + 2)", it is
expanded as described in the DATA TYPES section, below.  The match is
then performed on the string returned from the expansion.  If the
argument is an attribute reference (e.g. &User-Name), then the match
is performed on the value of that attribute.  Otherwise, the argument
is taken to be a literal string, and and matching is done via simple
comparison.

.DS
	case <argument> {
.br
		...
.br
	}
.DE

A default entry can be defined by omitting the argument, as given
below.  This entry will be used if no other "case" entry matches.
Only one default entry can exist in a "switch" section.

.DS
	case {
.br
		...
.br
	}
.DE
.IP update
.br
This keyword has been removed in v4.  Please see the new edit syntax.

.SH CONDITIONS
The conditions are similar to C conditions in syntax, though
quoted strings are supported, as with the Unix shell.
.IP Simple
conditions
.br
.DS
	(foo)
.DE

Evaluates to true if 'foo' is a non-empty string (single quotes, double
quotes, or back-quoted).  Also evaluates to true if 'foo' is a
non-zero number.  Note that the language is poorly typed, so the
string "0000" can be interpreted as a numerical zero.  This issue can
be avoided by comparing strings to an empty string, rather than by
evaluating the string by itself.

If the word 'foo' is not a quoted string, then it can be taken as a
reference to a named attribute.  See "Referencing attribute lists",
below, for examples of attribute references.  The condition evaluates
to true if the named attribute exists.

Otherwise, if the word 'foo' is not a quoted string, and is not an
attribute reference, then it is interpreted as a reference to a module
return code.  The condition evaluates to true if the most recent
module return code matches the name given here.  Valid module return
codes are given in MODULE RETURN CODES, below.
.IP Negation
.DS
	(!foo)
.DE

Evaluates to true if 'foo' evaluates to false, and vice-versa.
.PP
Short-circuit operators
.RS
.br
.DS
	(foo || bar)
.br
	(foo && bar)
.DE

"&&" and "||" are short-circuit operators.  "&&" evaluates the first
condition, and evaluates the second condition if and only if the
result of the first condition is true.  "||" is similar, but executes
the second command if and only if the result of the first condition is
false.
.RE
.IP Comparisons
.DS
	(foo == bar)
.DE

Compares 'foo' to 'bar', and evaluates to true if the comparison holds
true.  Valid comparison operators are "==", "!=", "<", "<=", ">",
">=", "=~", and "!~", all with their usual meanings.  Invalid
comparison operators are ":=" and "=".
.RE
.IP Attribute\ Comparisons
.DS
	(&User-Name == "foo")
.DE

Compares the value of the User-Name attribute to the string 'foo', and
evaluates to true if the comparison holds true.  The comparison is
done by printing the attribute to a string, and then doing a string
comparison of the two sides of the condition.
.RE
.IP Inter-Attribute\ Comparisons
.DS
	(&User-Name == &Filter-Id)
.DE

Compares the value of the User-Name attribute to the contents of the
Filter-Id attribute, and evaluates to true if the comparison holds
true.  Unlike the previous example, this comparison is done in a
type-safe way.  For example, comparing the IP addresses 1.2.3.4 and
127.0.0.1 as strings will return different results than comparing them
as IP addresses.

The "&" character in the condition means that the comparison "refers"
to the Filter-Id attribute.  If left off, it means that the User-Name
attribute is compared to the literal string "Filter-Id".

Where the left-hand side is an attribute, the "&" can be omitted.
However, it is allowed for backwards compatibility.  e.g. The comparison
"(&User-Name == &Filter-Id)" is equivalent to the example above.

We recommend using attribute references instead of printing
attributes to a string, e.g. (User-Name == "%{Filter-Id}").
Attribute references will be faster and more efficient.

The conditions will check only the first occurrence of an attribute.
If there is more than one instance of an attribute, the following
syntax should be used:

.DS
	(&Attribute-Name[*] == "foo")
.DE

Using the "[*]" syntax means that it checks all of the instances of
the named attribute.  If one attribute matches, the condition
succeeds.  If none match, the condition fails.

.RE
.IP Casts
.DS
	(<type>foo == bar)
.DE

The left-hand-side of a condition can be "cast" to a specific data
type.  The data type must be one which is valid for the dictionaries.
e.g. "integer", "ipaddr", etc.

The comparison is performed in a type-safe way, as with
"Inter-Attribute Comparisons", above.  Both sides of the condition are
parsed into temporary attributes, and the attributes compared via
type-specific methods.  The temporary attributes have no other effect,
and are not saved anywhere.

Casting allows conditions to perform type-specific comparisons.  In
previous versions of the server, the data would have to be manually
placed into an intermediate attribute (or attributes), and then the
attribute (or attributes) compared.  The use of a cast allows for
simpler policies.

Casts are allowed only on the left-hand side argument of a condition.
.PP
Conditions may be nested to any depth, subject only to line length
limitations (8192 bytes).
.SH DATA TYPES
There are only a few data types supported in the language.  Reference
to attributes, numbers, and strings.  Any data type can appear in
stand-alone condition, in which case they are evaluated as described
in "Simple conditions", above.  They can also appear (with some
exceptions noted below) on the left-hand or on the right-hand side of
a comparison.
.IP numbers
Numbers are composed of decimal digits.  Floating point, hex, and
octal numbers are not supported.  The maximum value for a number is
machine-dependent, but is usually 32-bits, including one bit for a
sign value.
.PP
word
.RS
Text that is not enclosed in quotes is interpreted differently
depending on where it occurs in a condition.  On the left hand side of
a condition, it is interpreted as a reference to an attribute.  On the
right hand side, it is interpreted as a simple string, in the same
manner as a single-quoted string.

Using attribute references permits limited type-specific comparisons,
as seen in the examples below.

.DS
	if (&User-Name == "bob") {
.br
		...
.br
	if (&Framed-IP-Address > 127.0.0.1) {
.br
		...
.br
	if (&Service-Type == Login-User) {
.DE
.RE
.IP """strings"""
.RS
Double-quoted strings are expanded by inserting the value of any
attributes (see VARIABLES, below) before being evaluated.  If
the result is a number it is evaluated in a numerical context.

String length is limited by line-length, usually about 8000
characters.  A double quote character can be used in a string via
the normal back-slash escaping method.  ("like \\"this\\" !")
.RE
.IP 'strings'
Single-quoted strings are evaluated as-is.  Their values are not
expanded as with double-quoted strings above, and they are not
interpreted as attribute references.
.IP `strings`
Back-quoted strings are evaluated by expanding the contents of the
string, as described above for double-quoted strings.  The resulting
command given inside of the string in a sub-shell, and taking the
output as a string.  This behavior is much the same as that of Unix
shells.

Note that for security reasons, the input string is split into command
and arguments before string expansion is done.

For performance reasons, we suggest that the use of back-quoted
strings be kept to a minimum.  Executing external programs is
relatively expensive, and executing a large number of programs for
every request can quickly use all of the CPU time in a server.  If you
believe that you need to execute many programs, we suggest finding
alternative ways to achieve the same result.  In some cases, using a
real language may be sufficient.

.IP /regex/[i][m][s][u][x]
These strings are valid only on the right-hand side of a comparison,
and then only when the comparison operator is "=~" or "!~".  They are
regular expressions, as implemented by the local regular expression
library on the system.  Supported regular expression implementations
are Posix, libpcre, and libpcre2.

The trailing characters after the end of the expression are flags
which alter how the expression is interpreted.

The 'i' flag indicates that the regular expression match should be
done in a case-insensitive fashion.

The 'm' flag indicates that carrot '^' and dollar '$' anchors should
match on new lines as well as at the start and end of the subject
string.

The 's' flag causes '.' to match all characters including newlines.

The 'u' flag tells the regex engine to assume all input and pattern
strings are UTF8 encoded, this affects how the regex engine
performs case insensitive matching, and causes it to treat multibyte
characters as single atoms.

The 'x' flag  causes most whitespace characters are ignored, and if
a line contains a '#' char, the line content after the '#' is ignored.
The primary use of the 'x' flag is to aid readability of complex
expressions.

Note the 's', 'u', and 'x' flags are only supported when the server
is built with libpcre or libpcre2.

If the comparison operator is "=~", then parentheses in the regular
expression will define variables containing the matching text, as
described below in the VARIABLES section.
.SH EXPANSIONS
Attributes are expanded using the ATTRIBUTE REFERENCE syntax
described above, and surrounding the reference with "%{...}"

.DS
	%{Attribute-Reference}
.DE

The result will be a string which contains the value of the attribute
which was referenced, as a printable string.  If the attribute does
not exist, the result will be an empty string.
.PP
Results of regular expression matches
.RS
If a regular expression match has previously been performed, then the
special variable %{0} will contain a copy of the matched portion of
the input string.  The variables %{1} through %{32} will contain the
substring matches, starting from the left-most capture group, onwards.
If there are more than 32 capture groups, the additional results will
not be accessible.
If the server is built with libpcre or libpcre2, the results of named
capture groups are available using the "%{regex:capture group}"
expansion.  They will also be accessible using the variables described
above.
Every time a regular expression is evaluated, whether it matches or not,
the capture group values will be cleared.
.RE
.PP
Obtaining results from databases
.RS
It is useful to query a database for some information, and to use the
result in a condition.  The following syntax will call a module, pass
it the given string, and replace the string expansion with the
resulting string returned from the module.

.DS
	%{module:string ...}
.DE

The syntax of the string is module-specific.  Please read the module
documentation for additional details.  If a literal "}" character is
needed inside of an expansion, it should be escaped as "%}".  e.g.
"%{module:This uses {braces%} as an example}"

Many modules will take data that is dynamically expanded, e.g.
"%{module:%{Attribute-Name}}".  The expansion will be turned into a
static string before it is passed to the module.
.RE
.PP
Conditional Syntax
.RS
Conditional syntax similar to that used in Unix shells may also be
used.
.IP %{%{Foo}:-bar}
If %{Foo} has a value, returns that value.
.br
Otherwise, returns literal string "bar".
.IP %{%{Foo}:-%{Bar}}
If %{Foo} has a value, returns that value.
.br
Otherwise, returns the expansion of %{Bar}.

These conditional expansions can be nested to almost any depth, such
as with %{%{One}:-%{%{Two}:-%{Three}}}
.RE
.PP
String lengths and arrays
.RS
Similar to a Unix shell, there are ways to reference string lengths,
and the second or more instance of an attribute in a list.  If you
need more than this functionality, we suggest using a real language.
.IP %{strlen:string}
The number of characters in "string".  If "string" does not exist,
then the length also does not exist, instead of being zero.

The "string" is expanded before the length is taken.

.IP %(integer:Value)
The integer value of the Value.

e.g. If a request contains "Service-Type = Login-User", the expansion
of %(integer:%{Service-Type}) will yield "1".

.IP %{hex:Attribute-Name}
The hex value of the Attribute-Name, as a series of hex digits.

e.g. If a request contains "Framed-IP-Address = 127.0.0.1", the expansion
of %{hex:Framed-IP-Address} will yield "0x7f000001".

.IP %{Attribute-Name[#]}
The number of instances of Attribute-Name.

e.g. If a request contains "User-Name = bob", the expansion
of %{User-Name[#]} will yield "1".

.IP %{Attribute-Name[*]}
All values of Attribute-Name, concatenated together with ',' as the
separator.

.IP %{List-Name:[#]}
The number of attributes in the named list.

.IP %{List-Name:[*]}
All values of attributes in the named-list, concatenated together with ','
as the separator. Use the %(pairs:) xlat to get a list of attributes and
values.

e.g. If a response contains "Reply-Message = 'Hello', Reply-Message = 'bob'
the expansion of "%{reply.Reply-Message[*]} will yield "Hello\\nbob"

.SH ATTRIBUTE ASSIGNMENTS
The attributes described above may be edited by simply assigning a
value..  Once the attributes have been defined, they may be referenced
as described above in the VARIABLES section.

The following syntax defines how to edit an attribute.  Each attribute
and value has to be all on one line in the configuration file.  There
is no need for commas or semi-colons after the value.

.DS
	&Attribute-Reference = value
.DE

Please see the HTML documentation for more information.

.SH OTHER KEYWORDS
Other keywords in the language are taken from the names of modules
loaded by the server.  These keywords are dependent on both the
modules, and the local configuration.

Some use keywords that are defined in the default configuration file
are:
.IP fail
Cause the request to be treated as if a database failure had occurred.
.IP noop
Do nothing.  This also serves as an instruction to the configurable
failover tracking that nothing was done in the current section.
.IP ok
Instructs the server that the request was processed properly.  This
keyword can be used to over-ride earlier failures, if the local
administrator determines that the failures are not catastrophic.
.IP reject
Causes the request to be immediately rejected
.SH MODULE RETURN CODES
When a module is called, it returns one of the following codes to
"unlang", with the following meaning.

.DS
	notfound        information was not found
.br
	noop            the module did nothing
.br
	ok              the module succeeded
.br
	updated         the module updated the request
.br
	fail            the module failed
.br
	reject          the module rejected the request
.br
	disallow        the user was locked out
.br
	invalid         the configuration was invalid
.br
	handled         the module has handled the request itself
.DE

These return codes can be tested for in a condition, as described
above in the CONDITIONS section.

See also the file doc/configurable_failover for additional methods of
trapping and modifying module return codes.

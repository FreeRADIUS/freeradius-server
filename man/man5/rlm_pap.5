.TH rlm_pap 5 "10 January 2015" "" "FreeRADIUS Module"
.SH NAME
rlm_pap \- FreeRADIUS Module
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fIrlm_pap\fP module authenticates RADIUS Access-Request packets
that contain a User-Password attribute.  The module should also be
listed last in the \fIauthorize\fP section, so that it can set the
Auth-Type attribute as appropriate.
.PP
When a RADIUS packet contains a clear-text password in the form of a
User-Password attribute, the \fIrlm_pap\fP module may be used for
authentication.  The module requires a "known good" password, which it
uses to validate the password given in the RADIUS packet.  That "known
good" password must be supplied by another module
(e.g. \fIrlm_files\fP, \fIrlm_ldap\fP, etc.), and is usually taken
from a database.
.SH CONFIGURATION
.PP
The only configuration item is:
.IP normalise
The default is "yes".  This means that the module will try to
automatically detect passwords that are hex- or base64-encoded and
decode them back to their binary representation.  However, some clear
text passwords may be erroneously converted.  Setting this to "no"
prevents that conversion.
.SH USAGE
.PP
The module looks for the Password-With-Header control attribute to find
the "known good" password. The attribute value comprises the header
followed immediately by the password data. The header is given by the
following table.

.DE

The module tries to be flexible when handling the various password
formats.  It will automatically handle Base-64 encoded data, hex
strings, and binary data, and convert them to a format that the server
can use.
.PP
If there is no Password-With-Header attribute, the module looks for one
of the Cleartext-Password, NT-Password, Crypt-Password, etc. attributes
as listed in the above table. These attributes should contain the
relevant format password directly, without the header prefix.
.PP
Only one control attribute should be set, otherwise behaviour is
undefined as to which one is used for authentication.
.SH NOTES
.PP
It is important to understand the difference between the User-Password
and Cleartext-Password attributes.  The Cleartext-Password attribute
is the "known good" password for the user.  Simply supplying the
Cleartext-Password to the server will result in most authentication
methods working.  The User-Password attribute is the password as typed
in by the user on their private machine.  The two are not the same,
and should be treated very differently.  That is, you should generally
not use the User-Password attribute anywhere in the RADIUS
configuration.

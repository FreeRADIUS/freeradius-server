.SH NAME
clients.conf \- FreeRADIUS client configuration
.SH DESCRIPTION
The 
.I clients.conf
file contains definitions of RADIUS clients.
.PP
The information in this file overrides any information provided in
the deprecated 
.BR clients
and 
.BR naslist
files.
.PP
The file format is the same as that used for
.I radiusd.conf.
See 
.BR radiusd.conf (5)
for more details.
.PP
Each RADIUS client entry has the following basic form:
.IP
.nf
client <short-name> {
       <attribute> = <value>
 }
.fi
.PP
Clients have many configuration parameters. Most are documented in the file
itself as comments. This page documents only the format of the file. Please
read the \fBclients.conf\fP file itself for more information.

The old-style format from 1.x is still accepted by the server, but
that form is deprecated.

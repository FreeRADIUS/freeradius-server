/*
 *  2. Overview of the Protocol
 *
 *  Any transfer begins with a request to read or write a file, which
 *  also serves to request a connection.  If the server grants the
 *  request, the connection is opened and the file is sent in fixed
 *  length blocks of 512 bytes.  Each data packet contains one block of
 *  data, and must be acknowledged by an acknowledgment packet before the
 *  next packet can be sent.  A data packet of less than 512 bytes
 *  signals termination of a transfer.  If a packet gets lost in the
 *  network, the intended recipient will timeout and may retransmit his
 *  last packet (which may be data or an acknowledgment), thus causing
 *  the sender of the lost packet to retransmit that lost packet.  The
 *  sender has to keep just one packet on hand for retransmission, since
 *  the lock step acknowledgment guarantees that all older packets have
 *  been received.  Notice that both machines involved in a transfer are
 *  considered senders and receivers.  One sends data and receives
 *  acknowledgments, the other sends acknowledgments and receives data.

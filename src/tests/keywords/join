#
#  Don't insert this string into the request list, because we're getting its value
#  from all of the request attributes.  And the insertion of the new attribute happens before the
#  RHS value is created?  That seems wrong...
#
#  This is because edit_list_pair_build() is called before the value is created, when we're trying to
#  see if the attribute already exists.  In order to fix this, we have to create the value first, and
#  then modify the list.  Changing that involves fixing the logic in edit.c to check for ":=", and if
#  it is there, do a simple "find" first.
#
#  @todo - fix this...

#
#  REVISIT THIS WHEN WE HAVE SOME CLEAR RULES ABOUT NULL ASSIGNMENTS
#


#
#  State doesn't exist, so Class shouldn't be created
#
update request {
	Class := State
}
if (Class) {
	test_fail
}

#
#  Strings which quote NULL expansions still result in zero-length strings.
#
#
update request {
	Filter-Id := "%{Reply-Message}"
}
if (!Filter-Id) {
	test_fail
}
if (!(Filter-Id == '')) {
	test_fail
}

#
#  NULL valued octet strings get converted to zero length octets strings?!
#
#  @fixme - EDIT - the new method is to simply omit the assignment
#
update request {
	Class := "%{Reply-Message}"
}
if (!(Class == "")) {
	test_fail
}

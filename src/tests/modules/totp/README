BEFORE TESTING TOTP
===================
Make the freeradius-server tree  from the top-level freeradius directory, like
this:

freeradius-server> make

You will also need an OTP generator, such as the Google Authenticator
app.

For a configurable online authenticator that can be used to test with
different OTP lengths and values, you can use;

https://totp.danhersam.com

TO TEST TOTP AUTHENTICATION FUNCTION
====================================
In this directory, run:

freeradius/src/tests/modules/totp> make test

Currently tests the authentication functions for 8-bit OTPs.

TO TEST FULL FUNCTIONALITY
==========================

First, set-up the RADIUS configuration.

Set the TOTP-Secret value (in ./raddb-totp/radiusd.conf) to
the value in use by your OTP authenticator.  Alternatively,
you may be able to set the Secret in your authenticator to
match the value in the radiusd.conf file...  The important
point is that they need to match.

The configuration defaults to a 6-digit OTP.  If you
are using an 8-digit OTP or want to test with non-default
configuration options, you can edit the "totp" section in
./raddb-totp/radiusd.conf.

In one terminal window, run:

freeradius/src/tests/modules/totp> sh radiusd.sh

To bring up a RADIUS server configured to authenticate with TOTP,
using the radiusd.conf file in ./raddb-totp and the local ./users
file.

In another terminal window::

Edit the ./user_password file to set User-Password to the
current OTP value.

Then, type:

freeradius/src/tests/modules/totp> sh radclient.sh

To run radclient from the local build tree, with input from
the ./user_password file.

## EAP-TTLS
#
#  The TTLS module implements the EAP-TTLS protocol,
#  which can be described as EAP inside of Diameter,
#  inside of TLS, inside of EAP, inside of RADIUS...
#
#  Surprisingly, it works quite well.
#
ttls {
	#  Which tls-config section the TLS negotiation parameters
	#  are in - see EAP-TLS above for an explanation.
	#
	#  In the case that an old configuration from FreeRADIUS
	#  v2.x is being used, all the options of the tls-config
	#  section may also appear instead in the 'tls' section
	#  above. If that is done, the tls= option here (and in
	#  tls above) MUST be commented out.
	#
	tls = tls-common

	#  The tunneled EAP session needs a default EAP type
	#  which is separate from the one for the non-tunneled
	#  EAP module.  Inside of the TTLS tunnel, we recommend
	#  using EAP-MD5.  If the request does not contain an
	#  EAP conversation, then this configuration entry is
	#  ignored.
	#
	default_eap_type = md5

	#
	#  The inner tunneled request can be sent
	#  through a virtual server constructed
	#  specifically for this purpose.
	#
	#  If this entry is commented out, the inner
	#  tunneled request will be sent through
	#  the virtual server that processed the
	#  outer requests.
	#
	virtual_server = "inner-tunnel"

	#  This has the same meaning, and overwrites, the
	#  same field in the "tls" configuration, above.
	#  The default value here is "yes".
	#
	include_length = no

	#
	# Unlike EAP-TLS, EAP-TTLS does not require a client
	# certificate. However, you can require one by setting the
	# following option. You can also override this option by
	# setting
	#
	#	EAP-TLS-Require-Client-Cert = Yes
	#
	# in the control items for a request.
	#
#	require_client_cert = yes

#  Note that it is the EAP MS-CHAPv2 sub-module, not
#  the main 'mschap' module.
#
#  Note also that in order for this sub-module to work,
#  the main 'mschap' module MUST ALSO be configured.
#
#  This module is the *Microsoft* implementation of MS-CHAPv2
#  in EAP.  There is another (incompatible) implementation
#  of MS-CHAPv2 in EAP by Cisco, which FreeRADIUS does not
#  currently support.

	#  Prior to version 2.1.11, the module never
	#  sent the MS-CHAP-Error message to the
	#  client.  This worked, but it had issues
	#  when the cached password was wrong.  The
	#  server *should* send "E=691 R=0" to the
	#  client, which tells it to prompt the user
	#  for a new password.
	#
	#  The default is to behave as in 2.1.10 and
	#  earlier, which is known to work.  If you
	#  set "send_error = yes", then the error
	#  message will be sent back to the client.
	#  This *may* help some clients work better,
	#  but *may* also cause other clients to stop
	#  working.

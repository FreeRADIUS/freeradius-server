#  tmpl_dcursor.c has an assert which fails if you try to use
#  conditional filters.

#  And we do not (yet) allow for filters on leaf attributes.  See

#
condition User-Name[(User-Name == 'bar')] == "foo"
match ERROR offset 11: Invalid filter - cannot use filter on leaf attributes

#
#  The condition code doesn't allow Group-Thingy == { foo = bar }
#
#  Arguably it could, but that wouldn't help here.
#
#  What we really want to allow is a filter for use with 'foreach':
#
#	foreach TLS-Certificate[Common-Name == 'user@example.com'] { ... }
#
#  which is a loop that returns TLS-Certificate.
#
#  @todo - feature - this error is misleading and wrong.

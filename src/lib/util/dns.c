/** Compress "label" by looking at the label recursively.
 *
 *  For "ftp.example.com", it searches the input buffer for a matching
 *  "com".  It only does string compares if it finds bytes "03 xx xx
 *  xx 00".  This means that the scan is quick, because most bytes are
 *  skipped.
 *
 *  If a matching string is found, the label is updated to replace
 *  "com" with a 2-byte pointer P1.  The process then proceeds
 *  recursively, with "exampleP1".
 *
 *  The input buffer is the scanned again for labels of matching
 *  length (7 here), AND which either end in the value of "P1", or end
 *  *at* P1.  If we find a match, we replace "exampleP1" with "P2".
 *  The process then proceeds recursively with "ftpP2".
 *
 *  Since the algorithm replaces known suffixes with pointers, we
 *  *never* have to compare full names.  Instead, we only ever compare
 *  one label to one other label.  And then only if the labels have
 *  the same lengths AND the same suffixes (00 byte, or a pointer P).
 *
 *  As an extra optimization, we track the start of the label where we
 *  found the compressed pointer.  e.g. "www.example.com" when
 *  compressing "com".  We know that the "com" string CANNOT appear
 *  before this label.  Because if it did, then the "www.example.com"
 *  name would have instead been compressed, as in "www.exampleP1".
 *
 *  This optimization ensures that we scan as little of the buffer as
 *  possible, by moving the search start ahead in the buffer.  This
 *  optimization also means that in many cases, the suffix we're
 *  looking for (e.g. "example.com") is in the first label we search.
 *  Which means that we end up ignoring most of the buffer.
 *
 *  This algorithm is O(N * B), where N is the number of labels in a
 *  name (e.g. 3 for "ftp.example.com"), and "B" is the size of the
 *  buffer.  It also does linear scans of the buffer, which are good
 *  for read-ahead.  Each input label is compared to labels in the
 *  buffer only when very limited situations apply.  And we never
 *  compare the full input name to full names in the buffer.
 *
 *  In the case where we are adding many names from the same zone to
 *  the input buffer, the input buffer will start with the zone name.
 *  So any searches will match that.  The only reason to continue
 *  scanning the buffer is to see if the name prefix already exists.
 *  If we assume that the records do not contain duplicates, then we
 *  can likely skip that scan, too.
 *
 *  Adding that optimization, however, requires tracking the maximum
 *  size of a name across multiple invocations of the function.  For
 *  example, if the maximum length name in the buffer is 3 labels, and
 *  we're adding a 3 label name, then we can stop scanning the buffer
 *  as soon as we compressed the 2 suffix labels.  Since we are
 *  guaranteed that there are no duplicates, we are sure that there is
 *  no existing 3-label name which matches a 3-label name in the
 *  buffer.
 *
 *  Note that this function does NOT follow pointers in the input
 *  buffer!
 *
 *
 *  A different and more straightforward approach is to loop over all
 *  labels in the name from longest to shortest, and comparing them to
 *  each name in the buffer in turn.  That algorithm ends up being
 *  O(L1 * T * L2), where L1 is the length of the input name, T is the
 *  total number of names in the buffer, and L2 is the average length
 *  of names in the buffer.  This algorithm can result in the buffer
 *  being scanned many, many, times.  The scan is also done forwards
 *  (due to comparing names one after the other), but also backwards
 *  (due to following pointers).  Which makes for poor locality of
 *  reference.
 *
 *  i.e. that approach *has* to scan the entire input buffer, because
 *  that's where all of the names are.  Further, it has to scan it at
 *  least "N" times, because there are N labels in the input name.  So
 *  O(N * B) is the *lower* bound for this algorithm.
 *
 *  It gets worse when the straightforward algorithm does pointer
 *  following instead of pointer comparisons.  It ends up scanning
 *  portions of the input buffer many, many, times.  i.e. it can
 *  compare an input "com" name to "org" once for every "org" name in
 *  the input buffer.  In contrast, because our algorithm does not do
 *  pointer following, it only compares "com" to "org" once.

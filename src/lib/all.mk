#  LOVE to be able to do:

#	$${libfreeradius-${1}.la_OBJS}: | src/include/${1}
#
#  but GNU Make is too stupid to wait until that variable is defined
#  to evaluate the condition.  Instead, it evaluates the rule
#  immediately, and decides that nothing is there.
#
#  So, we instead depend on a targe which has already been defined.t
#  - This is a terrible hack

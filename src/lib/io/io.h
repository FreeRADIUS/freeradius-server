 *  immediately after calling the write routine.  This means that if

 *  write callback on the socket, which is called when the socket is
 *  ready for writing.  That callback can then write the internal
 *  buffer to the socket.
 *
 *  i.e. this write() function is a way for the network thread to
 *  write packets to the transport context.  The data may or may not
 *  go out to the network right away.
 *
 *  If the writer returns LESS THAN buffer_len, that's a special case

/** Load generation configuration.
 *
 *  The load generator runs a callback periodically in order to
 *  generate load.  The callback MUST do all of the work, and track
 *  all necessary state itself.  The load generator simply provides a
 *  periodic signal.
 *
 *  The load begins with "start_pps", and ends after ramping up to
 *  "max_pps", no matter how long that takes.  The ramp-up is done by
 *  "step" increments.  Each step is run for "duration" seconds.
 *
 *  The callback is run "1/pps" times per second.
 *
 *  In order to send higher load, it is possible to run the callback
 *  "parallel" times per timeout.  i.e. with "start_pps = 100", and
 *  "parallel = 10", the load generator will run the callback 10
 *  times, wait 1/10s, run the callback another 10 times, and so on.
 *
 *  In order to prevent the load generator from overloading the
 *  backend, we have a configurable maximum backlog.  i.e. packets
 *  sent without reply.  This backlog is expressed in milliseconds of
 *  packets, *not* in numbers of packets.  Expressing the backlog this
 *  way allows it to automatically scale to higher loads.
 *
 *  i.e. if the generator is senting 10K packets/s, and the
 *  "milliseconds" parameter is 1000, then the generator will allow
 *  10K packets in the backlog.
 *
 *  Once the backlog limit is reached, the load generator will switch
 *  to a "gated" method of sending packets. It will only send one new
 *  packet when it has received a reply for one old packet.
 *
 *  If the generator receives many replies and the backlog is lower
 *  than the limit, the generator switches again to sending the
 *  configured "pps" packets
 *
 *  The generator will try to increase the packet rate after
 *  "duration" seconds, even if the maximum backlog is currently
 *  reached.  This increase has the effect of also increasing the
 *  maximum backlog.

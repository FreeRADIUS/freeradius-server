/** Write a socket.
 *
 *  If the socket is a datagram socket, then the function can read or
 *  write directly into the buffer.  Stream sockets are a bit more complicated.
 *
 *  A stream reader can read data into the buffer, and be guaranteed
 *  that the data will not change in between subsequent calls to the
 *  read routine.
 *
 *  A stream writer MUST be prepared for the caller to delete the data
 *  immediately after calling the write routine.  This means that if
 *  the socket is not ready, the writer MUST copy the data to an
 *  internal buffer, usually in instance.  It MUST then have a
 *  write callback on the socket, which is called when the socket is
 *  ready for writing.  That callback can then write the internal
 *  buffer to the socket.
 *
 *  i.e. this write() function is a way for the network thread to
 *  write packets to the transport context.  The data may or may not
 *  go out to the network right away.
 *
 *  If the write function does a partial write, it should return a
 *  value smaller than buffer_len to indicate this.  The network
 *  functions will then pass that value to a subsequent write call, in
 *  the "written" argument.
 *
 *  The reason for this odd API is that read/write should be writing
 *  *packets*, not raw streams of bytes.  This API allows the "buffer"
 *  parameter to always contain a full packet.

/** Inject data into a socket.
 *
 *  This function allows callers to inject data into a socket, just as if the data
 *  was read from a socket.
 *
 *  Note that this function is NOT an analog to fr_io_data_read_t.
 *  That is, the called function MUST copy the packet pointer into an
 *  internal list, so that subsequent calls to read() will return this
 *  packet.
 *
 *  The network side ensures that the packet buffer remains available
 *  to the called function for the duration of an inject() and read()
 *  call.  i.e. the packet contents do NOT have to be saved, and the
 *  code can instead save the pointer to the buffer.
 *
 *  However, this buffer MUST be immediately returned on a subsequent
 *  call to read().  If it is not returned, the memory is still freed,
 *  and the pointer becomes invalid.  Subsequent access to the buffer

 /**

 *
 * @brief Worker thread functions.
 * @file io/worker.c
 *
 *  The "worker" thread is the one responsible for the bulk of the
 *  work done when processing a request.  Workers are spawned by the
 *  scheduler, and create a kqueue (KQ) and control-plane
 *  Atomic Queue (AQ) for control-plane communication.
 *
 *  When a network thread discovers that it needs more workers, it
 *  asks the scheduler for a KQ/AQ combination.  The network thread
 *  then creates a channel dedicated to that worker, and sends the
 *  channel to the worker in a "new channel" message.  The worker
 *  receives the channel, and sends an ACK back to the network thread.
 *
 *  The network thread then sends the worker new packets, which the
 *  worker receives and processes.
 *
 *  When a packet is decoded, it is put into the "runnable" heap, and
 *  also into the "time_order" heap. The main loop fr_worker() then
 *  pulls new requests off of this heap and runs them.  The
 *  worker_check_timeouts() function also checks the tail of the
 *  "time_order" heap, and ages out requests which have been active
 *  for "too long".
 *
 *  A request may return one of RLM_MODULE_YIELD,
 *  RLM_MODULE_OK, or RLM_MODULE_HANDLED.  If a request is
 *  yielded, it is placed onto the yielded list in the worker
 *  "tracking" data structure.

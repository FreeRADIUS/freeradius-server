/** Generic interface for encoding one or more VALUE_PAIRs
 *
 * An encoding function should consume at most, one top level VALUE_PAIR and encode
 * it in the appropriate wire format for the protocol, writing the encoded data to
 * out, and returning the encoded length.
 *
 * The exception to processing one VALUE_PAIR is if multiple VALUE_PAIRs can be aggregated
 * into a single TLV, in which case the encoder may consume as many VALUE_PAIRs as will
 * fit into that TLV.
 *
 * Outlen provides the length of the buffer to write the encoded data to.  The return
 * value must not be greater than outlen.
 *
 * The cursor is used to track how many pairs there are remaining.
 *
 * @param[out] out		Where to write encoded data.  The encoding function should
 *				not assume that this buffer has been initialised, and must
 *				zero out any portions used for padding.
 * @param[in] outlen		The length of the buffer provided.
 * @param[in] cursor		Cursor containing the list of attributes to process.
 * @param[in] encoder_ctx	Any encoder specific data such as secrets or configurables.
 * @return
 *	- PAIR_ENCODE_SKIP - The current pair is not valid for encoding and should be skipped.
 *	- PAIR_ENCODE_ERROR - Encoding failed in a fatal way. Encoding the packet should be
 *	  aborted in its entirety.
 *	- <0 - The encoder ran out of space and returned the number of bytes as a negative
 *	  integer that would be required to encode the attribute.
 *	- >0 - The number of bytes written to out.

/** Allocate a new connection for the trunk

 * When creating new connections, this callback is used to allocate and configure

 *
 * - If there's no underlying I/O library, call `fr_trunk_connection_signal_readable(tconn)`
 *   immediately, relying on the trunk demux callback to perform decoding and demuxing.
 * - If there is an underlying I/O library, feed any incoming data to that library and
 *   then call #fr_trunk_connection_signal_readable if the underlying I/O library
 *   indicates complete responses are ready for processing.
 *
 * When the connection is writable a write I/O handler installed by the open() callback
 * of the #fr_connection_t must either:
 *
 * - If `always_writable == true` - Inform the underlying I/O library that the connection
 *   is writable.  The trunk API does not need to be informed as it will immediately pass
 *   through any enqueued requests to the I/O library.
 * - If `always_writable == false` and there's an underlying I/O library,
 *   call `fr_trunk_connection_signal_writable(tconn)` to allow the trunk mux callback
 *   to pass requests to the underlying I/O library and (optionally) signal the I/O library
 *   that the connection is writable.
 * - If `always_writable == false` and there's no underlying I/O library,

 *   Any resources like ID allocations bound to that request should
 *   also be freed.
 *   #fr_trunk_request_conn_release_t callback will not be called in this
 *   instance and cannot be used as an alternative.
 * - FR_TRUNK_CANCEL_REASON_MOVE - If an encoded request can be reused
 *   it should be kept.  The trunk mux callback should be aware that
 *   an encoded request may already be associated with a preq and use
 *   that instead of re-encoding the preq.
 *   If the encoded request cannot be reused it should be freed, and
 *   any fields in the preq that were modified during the last mux call
 *   (other than perhaps counters) should be reset to their initial values.
 *   Alternatively the #fr_trunk_request_conn_release_t callback can be used for
 *   the same purpose, as that will be called before the request is moved.
 * - FR_TRUNK_CANCEL_REASON_SIGNAL - The encoded request and any I/O library
 *   request handled may be freed though that may (optionally) be left to
 *   another callback like #fr_trunk_request_conn_release_t, as that will be
 *   called as the treq is removed from the conn.
 *   Note that the #fr_trunk_request_complete_t and
 *   #fr_trunk_request_fail_t callbacks will not be called in this
 *   instance.
 *
 * After this callback is complete one of several actions will be taken:
 *
 * - If the cancellation reason was FR_TRUNK_CANCEL_REASON_REQUEUE the
 *   treq will be placed back into the pending list of the connection it
 *   was previously associated with.
 * - If the cancellation reason was FR_TRUNK_CANCEL_REASON_MOVE, the treq
 *   will move to the unassigned state, and then either be placed in the
 *   trunk backlog, or immediately enqueued on another trunk connection.
 * - If the reason was FR_TRUNK_CANCEL_SIGNAL
 *   - ...and a request_cancel_mux callback was provided, the

/** @name Connection state signalling
 *
 * The following states are signalled from I/O event handlers:
 *
 * - writable - The connection is writable (the muxer will be called).
 * - readable - The connection is readable (the demuxer will be called).
 * - reconnect - The connection is likely bad and should be reconnected.
 *   If the code signalling has access to the conn, fr_connection_signal_reconnect
 *   can be used instead of fr_trunk_connection_signal_reconnect.
 *
 * The following states are signalled to control whether a connection may be
 * assigned new requests:
 *
 * - inactive - The connection cannot accept any new requests.  Either due to
 *   congestion or some other administrative reason.
 * - active - The connection can, once again, accept new requests.
 *
 * Note: In normal operation a connection will automatically transition between
 * the active and inactive states if conf->max_req_per_conn is specified and the
 * number of pending requests on that connection are equal to that number.
 * If however, the connection has previously been signalled inactive, it will not
 * automatically be reactivated once the number of requests drops below
 * max_req_per_conn.
 *
 * For other connection states the trunk API should not be signalled directly.
 * It will be informed by "watch" callbacks inserted into the #fr_connection_t as
 * to when the connection changes state.
 *
 * #fr_trunk_connection_signal_active does not need to be called in any of the
 * #fr_connection_t state callbacks.  It is only used to activate a connection
 * which has been previously marked inactive using
 * #fr_trunk_connection_signal_inactive.
 *
 * If #fr_trunk_connection_signal_inactive is being used to remove a congested
 * connection from the active list (i.e. on receipt of an explicit protocol level
 * congestion notification), consider calling #fr_trunk_connection_requests_requeue
 * with the FR_TRUNK_REQUEST_STATE_PENDING state to redistribute that connection's
 * backlog to other connections in the trunk.

 * @brief Multi-packet state handling
 * @file src/lib/server/state.c
 *
 * @ingroup AVP
 *
 * For each round of a multi-round authentication method such as EAP,
 * or a 2FA method such as OTP, a state entry will be created.  The state
 * entry holds data that should be available during the complete lifecycle
 * of the authentication attempt.
 *
 * When a request is complete, #fr_request_to_state is called to transfer
 * ownership of the state VALUE_PAIRs and state_ctx (which the VALUE_PAIRs
 * are allocated in) to a #fr_state_entry_t.  This #fr_state_entry_t holds the
 * value of the State attribute, that will be send out in the response.
 *
 * When the next request is received, #fr_state_to_request is called to transfer
 * the VALUE_PAIRs and state ctx to the new request.
 *
 * The ownership of the state_ctx and state VALUE_PAIRs is transferred as below:
 *
 * @verbatim
   request -> state_entry -> request -> state_entry -> request -> free()
          \-> reply                 \-> reply                 \-> access-reject/access-accept

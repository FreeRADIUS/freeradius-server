 *  returns a partial write, or WOULD BLOCK, then information about the packet is cached.  Subsequent writes
 *  will write the partial data first, and then continue with subsequent writes.
 *
 *  The caller is responsible for not freeing the packet ctx or the packet buffer until either the write has
 *  been performed, or the write has been cancelled.
 *
 *  The read() API makes no provisions for reading complete packets.  It simply returns whatever the next bio
 *  allows.  If instead there is a need to read only complete packets, then the next bio should be
 *  fr_bio_mem_alloc() with a fr_bio_mem_set_verify()
 *
 *  The read() API may return 0.  There may have been data read from an underlying FD, but that data did not
 *  make it through the filters of the "next" bios.  e.g. Any underlying FD should be put into a "wait for
 *  readable" state.
 *
 *  The write() API will return a full write, even if the next layer is blocked.  Any underlying FD
 *  should be put into a "wait for writeable" state.  The packet which was supposed to be written has been
 *  cached, and cannot be cancelled as it is partially written.  The caller should likely start using another
 *  bio for writes.  If the caller continues to use the bio, then any subsequent writes will *always* cache
 *  the packets. @todo - we need to mark up the bio as "blocked", and then have a write_blocked() API?  ugh.
 *  or just add `bool blocked` and `bool eof` to both read/write bios
 *
 *  Once the underlying FD has become writeable, the caller should call fr_bio_write(bio, NULL, NULL, SIZE_MAX);
 *  That will cause the pending packets to be flushed.
 *
 *  The write() API may return that it's written a full packet, in which case it's either completely written to
 *  the next bio, or to the pending queue.
 *
 *  The read / write APIs can return WOULD_BLOCK, in which case nothing was done.  Any underlying FD should be
 *  put into a "wait for writeable" state.  Other errors from bios "further down" the chain can also be
 *  returned.

/**

 * @file lib/bio/dedup.c
 * @brief Binary IO abstractions for deduping packets.
 *
 * The dedup BIO receives packets from the network, and allows for deduplication of requests, so that
 * duplicate requests are only processed once.  In addition, if a reply is available, a duplicate request will
 * result in a duplicate reply.  The actual deduplication tree / table has to be maintained by the calling
 * application, as packet comparisons for deduplication is very protocol-specific.  The purpose of the dedup
 * BIO is to abstract all of the common support functions around this limitation.
 *
 * When packets are read() from the next bio, the #fr_bio_dedup_receive_t callback is run.  It tells the BIO
 * whether or not the packet should be received, and whether or not the packet should be returned to the
 * caller.  The receive callback is also passed a #fr_bio_dedup_entry_t pointer, where the packet_ctx, packet,
 * and size are already filled out.  This entry is used to correlate requests and replies.
 *
 * When packets are write() to the network, the #fr_bio_dedup_get_item_t callback is called to get the
 * previously cached #fr_bio_dedup_entry_t pointer.  This is because there is no generic way to get an
 * additional context to this BIO via the write() routine.  i.e. the packet_ctx for write() may include things
 * like src/dst ip/port, and therefore can't always be an #fr_bio_dedup_entry_t.  The caller should associate
 * the #fr_bio_dedup_entry_t with the packet_ctx for the reply.  The get_item() routine can then return the entry.
 *
 * For simplicity, the next bio should be a memory one.  That way the read() can read more than one packet if
 * necessary.  And the write() can cache a partial packet if it blocks.
 *
 * The entry needs to be cached in order to maintain the internal tracking used by the dedup BIO.
 *
 * On client retransmit, the #fr_bio_dedup_receive_t callback is run, just as if it is a new packet.  The
 * dedup BIO does not know if the received data is a new packet until the #fr_bio_dedup_receive_t callback
 * says so.  On duplicate client request, the #fr_bio_dedup_receive_t callback can call fr_bio_dedup_respond()
 * to send a duplicate reply.  That call bypasses the normal dedup stack, and writes directly to the next bio.
 *
 * The calling application can also call fr_bio_dedup_respond() as soon as it has a reply.  i.e. skip the BIO
 * write() call.  That works, and is safe.
 *
 * The dedup BIO tracks a number of lists / trees internally.  Packets which are received but which have no
 * reply are in an "active" list.  Packets which have a reply are in an "expired" RB tree, where a timer is
 * set to expire packets.  If a write() call results in a partial write, that packet is put into a "partially
 * written" state.  If multiple calls to write() are done when writing is blocked, the replies are put into a
 * "pending" state.
 *
 * The calling application can always call fr_bio_dedup_cancel() to cancel or expire a packet.  This call is
 * safe, and can be made at any time, no matter what state the packet is in.

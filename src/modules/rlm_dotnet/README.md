## What I did for configuration

With Homebrew on OS X:

`./configure --with-openssl-lib-dir=/usr/local/opt/openssl@1.1/lib --with-openssl-include-dir=/usr/local/opt/openssl@1.1/include`

<https://github.com/dotnet/samples/tree/master/core/hosting/HostWithCoreClrHost>

`sudo make install` put everything in /usr/local as expected

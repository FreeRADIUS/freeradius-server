  This module implements SecurID token checking.  It should be listed
in the "aythenticate" section.

  The module configuration is in the "securid" file.  You will need to
copy it by hand to the raddb/modules/directory.

  There is no "configure" script.  Instead, you MUST edit the
"Makefile" by hand in order to build the module.  See the Makefile for
instructions.

  Many people will wonder about the license issues involved in
distributing this module.  The short answer is that the source can be
distributed, the binaries cannot be distributed.  The explanation
is given below.

  This module falls under the GPLv2 license.  The primary goal of this
license is largely to ensure that you have access to the source code,
which is included here.  A secondary goal of this license is to ensure
that binary distributions can be re-built from the existing source
code.  This is done by requiring binary distributions to offer source
code for the GPLd binary, and to distribute ALL DEPENDENT LIBRARIES.

  The RSA libraries are proprietary to RSA, and cannot be distributed.
Therefore, any library (rlm_securid.a, rlm_securid.so, etc.) CANNOT be
distributed by ANYONE.

  The module is still useful, of course.  The GPL restriction on
distribution apply only on distribution to third parties.  This means
that building the module, and using it within your organization is
allowed under the GPL.

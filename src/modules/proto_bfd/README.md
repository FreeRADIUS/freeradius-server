## Summary
Implements BiDirectional Forwarding Protocol (RFC 5880) - allowing the server to quickly detect if a link is up or down.
This module can be used to detect if a *peer* application is up or down and use the trigger module to execute certain functions when the link is started, goes up, down, or is administratively down.

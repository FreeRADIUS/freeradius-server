FreeRADIUS REDISN Module (authorize, accounting Freeradius module against REDIS)
Manuel Guesdon <mguesdon@oxymium.net> / Oxymium

It's mostly a copy of rlm_sql adapted to REDIS (http://redis.io/) key-store database
It need hiredis (https://github.com/antirez/hiredis)

Sample configuration file is in redisn.example

You can specify multiple redis servers.
It handle authorize, accounting, checksimul and post-auth

You can pass multiple queries, separated by \n in accounting part.

Only authorize part has been deeply tested.

You need to add:
ATTRIBUTE       Redis-Group                     1112    string
in dictionary.freeradius.internal

Global behaviour is like rlm_sql: see

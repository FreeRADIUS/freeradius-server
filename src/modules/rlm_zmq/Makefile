# TARGET should be set by autoconf only.  Don't touch it.

# The SRCS definition should list ALL source files.
#
# The HEADERS definition should list ALL header files
#
# RLM_CFLAGS defines addition C compiler flags.  You usually don't
# want to modify this, though.  Get it from autoconf.
#
# The RLM_LIBS definition should list ALL required libraries.
# These libraries really should be pulled from the 'config.mak'
# definitions, if at all possible.  These definitions are also
# echoed into another file in ../lib, where they're picked up by
# ../main/Makefile for building the version of the server with
# statically linked modules.  Get it from autoconf.
#
# RLM_INSTALL is the names of additional rules you need to install
# some particular portion of the module.  Usually, leave it blank.

.TH rlm_unbound 5 "8 July 2013" "" "FreeRADIUS Module"
.SH NAME
rlm_unbound \- FreeRADIUS Module
.SH DESCRIPTION
Each instance of \fIrlm_unbound\fP provides an embedded DNS client
for performing DNS lookups.  Each instance may be configured separately
to query different DNS horizons, change DNSSEC options, etc.
.PP
The module is primarily intended for use by other modules through
internal APIs, and so, instances should be initialized earlier than
those modules which use them.  Each instance does also provide some
xlat functionalities for general use and for troubleshooting.
.PP
Each instance of rlm_unbound may take the following parameters:
.IP filename
This file must exist and must point to a valid libunbound configuration file.
The default is ${raddbdir}/mods-config/unbound/default.conf.
.IP xlat_timeout
While libunbound provides an asyncronous API for internal use, using any xlat
is done syncronously from the perspective of unlang.  This value limits the
amount of time a request will wait for DNS to respond, after which the xlat
will fail.  The default is 3000 milliseconds.  This setting is independent of
any libunbound configuration values.
.PP
An instance named, for example, "dns" will provide the following xlat
functionalities:
.IP %{dns-a:<owner>}
Performs an A lookup for the owner name, returning a stringified IPv4
address.  Only the first A record in the RRSET will be returned.
.IP %{dns-aaaa:<owner>}
Performs an AAAA lookup for the owner name, returning a stringified IPv6
address.  Only the first AAAA record in the RRSET will be returned.
.IP %{dns-ptr:<owner>}
Performs a PTR lookup for the owner.

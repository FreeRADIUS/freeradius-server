/*
 * Generate the State attribute, suitable for passing to fr_pair_make().
 * 'challenge' must be a null terminated string, and be sized at least
 * as large as indicated in the function definition.
 *
 * Returns 0 on success, non-zero otherwise.  For successful returns,
 * 'rad_state' (suitable for passing to fr_pair_make()) and 'raw_state',
 * if non-NULL, will be filled in.
 *
 * In the simplest implementation, we would just use the challenge as state.
 * Unfortunately, the RADIUS secret protects only the User-Password
 * attribute; an attacker that can remove packets from the wire and insert
 * new ones can simply insert a replayed state without having to know
 * the secret.  If not for an attacker that can remove packets from the
 * network, I believe trivial state to be secure.
 *
 * So, we have to make up for that deficiency by signing our state with
 * data unique to this specific request.  A NAS would use the Request
 * Authenticator, but we don't know what that will be when the State is
 * returned to us, so we'll use the time.  So our replay prevention
 * is limited to a time interval (inst->challenge_delay).  We could keep
 * track of all challenges issued over that time interval for
 * better protection.
 *
 * Our state, then, is
 *   (challenge + flags + time + hmac(challenge + resync + time, key)),
 * where '+' denotes concatentation, 'challenge' is ... the challenge,
 * 'flags' is a 32-bit value that can be used to record additional info,
 * 'time' is the 32-bit time (LSB if time_t is 64 bits), and 'key' is a
 * random key, generated in mod_instantiate().  'flags' and 'time' are
 * in network byte order.
 *
 * As the signing key is unique to each server, only the server which
 * generates a challenge can verify it; this should be OK if your NAS's
 * load balance across RADIUS servers using a "first available" algorithm.
 * If your NAS's round-robin and don't "stick" to the same server if they
 * see a State attribute (ugh), you could use the RADIUS secret instead,
 * but read RFC 2104 first, and make very sure you really want to do this.
 *
 * Since only the "same server" can verify State, 'flags' and 'time' doesn't
 * really need to be in network byte order, but we do it anyway.
 *
 * The State attribute is an octet string, however some versions of Cisco
 * IOS and Catalyst OS (at least IOS 12.1(26)E4 and CatOS 7.6.12) treat it
 * as an ASCII string (they only return data up to the first NUL byte).
 * So we must handle state as an ASCII string (0x00 -> 0x3030).

#
#  Bidirectional Forwarding Detection.  RFC 5880
#  http:/ietf.org/rfc/rfc5880.txt
#
#  The purpose of BFD is to quickly detect if a link is up or down.
#  We are using it to determine if a "peer" application is up or down.
#  For example, when two servers are configured in primary / secondary
#  mode, they should be set up as BFD peers.  They can then detect
#  when the other one goes down.
#
#  The code is in FreeRADIUS because we want to know if the
#  *application* is running.  It doesn't matter if the link is up, or
#  if the host system is running.  If the FreeRADIUS daemon is down,
#  then we want to know ASAP.
#
#  See also raddb/trigger.conf.  There are BFD-specific triggers which
#  are executed when the link is started, goes up, down, or is
#  administratively down.

	# Type is bfd
	type = bfd

	# IP address, or IPv6 address as normal
	ipaddr = 127.0.0.1

	#  Port as normal
	port = 10000

	#  BFD Authentication method.  Can be:
	#
	#	none - no password, not recommended
	#	simple - cleartext password in the packet, not recommended
	#	keyed-md5 - MD5 based, like  RADIUS style shared secret key
	#	met-keyed-md5 - similar to above
	#	keyed-sha1 - SHA1 based, like RADIUS style shared secret key
	#	met-keyed-sha1 - similar to above
	#
	#  The other side of the BFD connection has to have the same
	#  kind of authentication set.
	#
	auth_type = keyed-sha1

	#  The secret key used for authentication.
	#  If it starts with "0x", then it is treated as a hex string.
	#  This is recommended for security.  The secrets should be ~16
	#  octets long, and random.
	#
	secret = "hello"

	#  The virtual server used to process the packet.
	#  See below for an example.
	#
	server = bfd

	#  Various timer functions, in milliseconds
	#  These can also be used in a "peer" section.
	#
	min_transmit_interval = 1000
	min_receive_interval = 1000
	max_timeouts = 3
	demand = no

	#  Each BFD "listen" socket has at least one, possibly more, peer.
	#  It exchanges BFD packets with each peer.
	#
	peer {
		#  Each peer has an IP address and a port.
		#  For now, you can't set a per-peer auth_type.
		#
		ipaddr = 127.0.0.1
		port = 10001

		#  BFD Demand mode.  Set to yes / no
		#
		demand = no

		#  Each peer should have its own unique secret.
		#  If this isn't set, the global secret above will
		#  be used.
		#
		secret = 0x12345678
       }
}

#  The virtual server used to handle BFD packets.
#  You can't really run any of the normal RADIUS modules here.
#  But you could run an external shell script, Perl, etc.
#
server bfd {
	bfd {
		# Say it's OK.
		ok

		#  Any other modules listed here will have their
		#  "authorize" section run.
	}
}

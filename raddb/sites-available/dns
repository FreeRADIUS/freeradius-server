#  = The DNS Virtual Server
#
#  The `dns` virtual server is an example of using `dns` style functionality in FreeRADIUS.
#
#  == The Virtual Server
#
#  This is the `dns` virtual server.
#
#  It's not meant to be fast.  Don't use it as a root server, or as a server for an ISP
#  with millions of users.  But it should be able to do thousands to tens of thousands
#  of queries per second, without really trying hard.
#
#  It's meant to be a _flexible_ DNS server.  Want to give different answers to VoIP phones
#  and desktops, or other types of split horizon?  It can do that.
#
#  Because DNS uses the Header.Rcode to communicate the result of a query (instead of opcode)
#  the DNS state machine works differently to other protocols.
#
#  Requests will pass through the following processing sections:
#  - A `recv { ... }` section matching the opcode. e.g. `recv Query { ... }`.  Query processing
#    and response formulation should be done here.
#    If this section returns anything other than `ok` or `updated`, a reply.Header.Rcode value is
#    set.
#  - An `error { ... }` section matching reply.Header.Rcode. e.g. `error Server-Fail { ... }`.
#    If the `recv { ... }` section produced a reply.Header.Rcode value other than `No-Error`
#    and a `error { ... } section matching the reply.Header.Rcode is provided, it is executed.
#    Error sections are intended only for simplifying logging, and as such, the rcode of the section is ignored.
#    Error sections can manipulate the reply, e.g. setting a new value for reply.Header.Rcode, but
#    this will not cause additional `error { ... }` section to be executed.
#  - A `send { ... }` section matching the opcode. e.g. `send Query-Response { ... }`.  This can be
#    used for general massaging of the reply.  Return codes are ignored.

#  = The DNS Virtual Server
#
#  The `dns` virtual server is an example of using `dns` style functionality in FreeRADIUS.
#
#  ## The Virtual Server
#
#  This is the `dns` virtual server.
#
#  It is (for now) only a toy.  It only decodes nested attributes, which `unlang`
#  cannot (yet) handle well.  It only handles a few types of RRs.  You have to manually
#  do pretty much everything necessary to make DNS "work".  There's no DB integration.
#
#  It's not meant to be fast.  Don't use it as a root server, or as a server for an ISP
#  with millions of users.  But it should be able to do thousands to tens of thousands
#  of queries per second, without really trying hard.
#
#  It's meant to be a _flexible_ DNS server.  Want to give different answers to VoIP phones
#  and desktops?  It can do that.

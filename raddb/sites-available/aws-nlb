#  A sample virtual server which handles "health checks" from Amazon
#  elastic load balancer.
#
#  https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/classic/elb-healthchecks.html
#
#  In the Amazon system, configure "proto" as "tcp", and "port" as the port
#  given below in the "listen" section.
#
#	$Id$
#
server aws-nlb {

#
#  This should be the IP address of the Amazon load balancer.
#
#  If TCP checks come from multiple IP addresses, just list each IP in a separate "client" section.
#
client aws-nlb {
	ipaddr = 192.0.2.1
	proto = tcp
	secret = "this-will-never-be-used"
}

#
#  Listen on a port.  Don't use 80, as that requires root permissions,
#  and you don't want to run radiusd as root.
#
listen {
	type = status
	proto = tcp
	ipaddr = *
	port = 8000
}

#
#  This will never get used, but it's here just in case we actually
#  get sent RADIUS packets.

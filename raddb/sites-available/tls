#  RADIUS over TLS (radsec)
#
#  When a new client connects, the various TLS parameters for the
#  connection are available as dynamic expansions, e.g.
#
#	%{listen:TLS-Client-Cert-Common-Name}
#
#  Along with other TLS-Client-Cert-... attributes.
#  These expansions will only exist if the relevant fields
#  are in the client certificate.  Read the debug output to see
#  which fields are available.  Look for output like the following:
#
# (0) TLS - Creating attributes from certificate OIDs
# (0)   TLS-Client-Cert-Subject-Alt-Name-Dns := "one.example.org"
# (0)   TLS-Client-Cert-Subject-Alt-Name-Dns := "two.example.org"
# ...
#
#  It is also possible to distinguish between connections which have
#  TLS enables, and ones which do not.  The expansion:
#
#	%{listen:tls}
#
#  Will return "yes" if the connection has TLS enabled.  It will
#  return "no" if TLS is not enabled for a particular listen section.
#
#  A number of TLS-Client-Cert-.. attributes holds X509v3 extensions
#  data, attributes named the way OpenSSL names them. It is possible
#  to extract data for an extension not known to OpenSSL by defining
#  a custom string attribute which contains extension OID in it's
#  name after 'TLS-Client-Cert-' prefix. E.g.:
#
#  ATTRIBUTE	TLS-Client-Cert-1.3.6.1.4.1.311.21.7	3002	string
#
#  which will yield something simmilar to:
#
#   (0) eap_tls: TLS - Creating attributes from certificate OIDs
#   (0) eap_tls:   TLS-Client-Cert-1.3.6.1.4.1.311.21.7 += "0x302e06"
#   ...

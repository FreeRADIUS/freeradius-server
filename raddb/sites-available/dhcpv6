	#  all_dhcp_servers_and_relays:: Predefined multicast address
	#  for DHCPv6 servers and relays.
	#
	#  This configuration item is here for convenience.  It allows
	#  each `listen` section below to use this definition, so that
	#  those sections do not need to list magic numbers.
	#
	all_dhcp_servers_and_relays = FF02::1:2

	#
	#  interface:: Ethernet interface for DHCPv6.
	#
	#  DHCPv6 servers require multiple listeners, one for multicast
	#  packets, and one for unicast packets.  Both listeners should
	#  use the same interface.  So it is defined here once, and used
	#  below.
	#
	interface = en0

	#
	#  port:: The port where we accept packets.

	#  packets, and one for unicast packets.  Both listeners should

	#  The default DHCPv6 port is `547`.  We use `5470` here, so that
	#  testing will not affect production systems.  This value should

	#
	#  ### The listen section
	#
	#  DHCPv6 relies on multicast packets to work.  We suggest
	#  defining only one DHCPv6 "listen" per host machine.  This
	#  suggestion is because all DHCPv6 listeners will receive all
	#  DHCPv6 packets.
	#
	listen {
		#
		#  type:: The type of packet to accept.
		#
		#  Multiple types can be accepted by using multiple
		#  lines of `type = ...`.

		#  is not supported.

		#  udp`, it looks for a "udp" subsection.  This
		#  subsection contains all of the configuration for
		#  the UDP transport.

			#  preferred.  When there is no IPv6 address
			#  for a host name, an error will occur.

			ipaddr = ${...all_dhcp_servers_and_relays}

			#
			#  port:: The port where we accept packets.
			#
			#   The port should be 547 for a production
			#   network. We do NOT suggest setting it to
			#   547 on a production network unless you
			#   know what you are doing. Even if nothing
			#   is configured below, the server may still
			#   NAK legitimate responses from clients.
			#
			port = ${...port}

			#
			#  When a multicast address is used for `ipaddr` above,
			#  and `interface` configuration MUST be given.
			#
			interface = ${...interface}

			#
			#  src_ipaddr:: The source IP address used for
			#  unicast messages.
			#
			#  If a `src_ipaddr` is not specified, then
			#  the server will try to choose one automatically:
			#
			#  * If `ipaddr` is unicast, then the server will use
			#    that as `src_ipaddr`, too.
			#
			#  * If `ipaddr` is multicast, then the server will
			#    look for the first "link local" address on the
			#    `interface` defined above, and use that.
			#
			#  In most cases, you should not need to specify
			#  `src_ipaddr`.

# This file represents a server that is implementing an identity
# provider for GSS-EAP (RFC 7055) using the trust router protocol for
# dynamic realm discovery.  Any ABFAB identity provider is also an
# ABFAB relying party proxy.

#This file does not include a TLS listener; see abfab-tls for a simple
# example of a RADSEC listener for ABFAB.

	#  If you are proxying LEAP, you MUST configure the EAP

	#  You MUST also use the 'nostrip' option in the 'realm'
	#  configuration.  Otherwise, the User-Name attribute

	#  hidden inside of the EAP packet, and the end server will

	#  The main use of this section is to permit robust proxying
	#  of accounting packets.  The server can be configured to
	#  proxy accounting packets as part of normal processing.
	#  Then, if the home server goes down, accounting packets can
	#  be logged to a local "detail" file, for processing with
	#  radrelay.  When the home server comes back up, radrelay
	#  will read the detail file, and send the packets to the
	#  home server.
	#
	#  With this configuration, the server always responds to
	#  Accounting-Requests from the NAS, but only writes
	#  accounting packets to disk if the home server is down.

#
#  This virtual server controls TLS sessions.
#
#  When a TLS session is used, the server will automatically create
#  attributes in the session-state list with details extracted from
#  the client certificate chain.
#
#  The number of certificates decoded depends on the setting of
#  setting of `attriubte_mode` in the `verify` section of the
#  appropriate TLS configuration.
#
#  Certificates are decoded into nested attributes e.g.
#
#	TLS-Certificate = {
#		Subject = '...',
#		Common-Name = '...',
#		Issuer = '...'
#	}
#
#  When more than one certificate is decoded, the first ( i.e.
#  session-state.TLS-Certificate[0] ) will be the client certificate,
#  with the next being its issuer.

	#  This section can be run to verify a client certificate if
	#  additional checks need to be performed beyond standard
	#  checks verification against a trust chain, CRLs and OCSP.
	#
	#  Attributes extracted from the certificates forming the
	#  client certificate chain will be in the session state list.
	#
	#  Returning 'ok', 'updated' or 'noop' will cause the verification
	#  to succeed.  Other return codes will cause the verification
	#  to fail.
	#
	verify certificate {
		#
		#  Check the client certificate matches a string, and reject otherwise
		#
#		if ("%{session-state.TLS-Certificate.Common-Name}" != 'client.example.com') {
#			reject
#		}

		#
		#  Check the client certificate common name against the supplied identity
		#
#		if (EAP-Identity != "host/%{session-state.TLS-Certificate.Common-Name}") {

		#
		#  This is a convenient place to call LDAP, for example, when using
		#  EAP-TLS, as it will only be called once, after all certificates as
		#  part of the EAP-TLS challenge process have been verified.
		#
		#  An example could be to use LDAP to check that the connecting host, as
		#  well as presenting a valid certificate, is also in a group based on
		#  the EAP-Identity (assuming this contains the service principal name).
		#  Settings such as the following could be used in the ldap module
		#  configuration:
		#
		#  basedn = "dc=example, dc=com"
		#  filter = "(servicePrincipalName=%{EAP-Identity})"
		#  base_filter = "(objectClass=computer)"
		#  groupname_attribute = cn
		#  groupmembership_filter = "(&(objectClass=group)(member=%{control.Ldap-UserDn}))"
		#

#		ldap

		#
		#  Now let's test membership of an LDAP group (the ldap bind user will
		#  need permission to read this group membership):
		#

#		if (!%ldap.group("Permitted-Laptops")) {
#			reject
#		}

		#  or, to be more specific, you could use the group's full DN:
		#  if (!%ldap.group("CN=Permitted-Laptops,OU=Groups,DC=example,DC=org")) {

		#
		#  This may be a better place to call the files modules when using
		#  EAP-TLS, as it will only be called once, after the challenge-response
		#  iteration has completed.

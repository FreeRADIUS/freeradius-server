#  = The cron Virtual Server
#
#  The `cron` virtual server is an example of using `cron` style functionality in FreeRADIUS.
#
#  ## The Virtual Server
#
#  This is the `cron` virtual server.
#
server cron {
	#
	#  namespace:: The protocol / dictionary to use.
	#
	#  The `cron` functionality can be used with any protocol.
	#
	namespace = radius

	#
	#  You can have a `radius` subsection here.  See the `default`
	#  virtual server for documentation.
	#

	#
	#  Create a `cron` listener.  Note that leaving off the `cron` name
	#  will result in the protocol trying to open a socket!
	#
	listen cron {
		#
		#  type:: What type of packet is being processed.
		#
		#  The `type` should be a valid name for the protocol.
		#
		type = Access-Request

		#
		#  transport: What kind of cron functionality we are using.
		#
		#  For now, only `crontab` is supported.
		#
		transport = crontab

		#
		#  crontab:: Run `crontab` style jobs.
		#
		crontab {
			#
			#  timespec:: the `crontab` style time specification.
			#
			#  The fields are:
			#
			#  * minute (0-59)
			#  * hour (0-59)
			#  * day of month (1-31)
			#  * month of year (1-12)
			#  * day of week (0-6)
			#
			#  The allowed values follow the specification given in
			#  `man 5 crontab`, or https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/crontab.5.html
			#
			#  Multiple values can be given, separated by comma:
			#  * 1,2,3
			#
			#  Ranges can be specified
			#  * 1-4
			#  * `*`
			#
			#  Steps can be given for ranges:
			#  * 1-20/4
			#
			timespec = "* * * * *"

			#
			#  filename:: The file which is read, cached, and processed
			#
			#  When the timer hits, the `cron` section processes the attributes
			#  from this file, as if they had been received from the network.
			#
			#  Nothing is done with the reply packet (if
			#  anything).  The `cron` functionality
			#  assumes that all of the work necessary for
			#  `cron` is done inside of the processing
			#  sections.

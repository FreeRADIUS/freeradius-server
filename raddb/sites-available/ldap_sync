#
#  Sample virtual server for receiving entries from an LDAP directory
#  using the RFC 4533 (LDAP Content Synchronization Operation) in
#  refreshAndPersist mode, Active Directory using its LDAP_SERVER_NOTIFY_OID
#  server control, or a directory implementing Persistent Search as
#  described in https://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-ietf-ldapext-psearch-03.txt

#
#  Persistent searches work in a similar way to normal searches except
#  they continue running indefinitely.  We continue to receive notifications
#  of changes (add, delete, modify) to entries that would have been returned
#  by a normal search with the base_dn, filter, and scope specified.
#
#  The intent of persistent searches is usually to allow directory content
#  to be replicated by another LDAP server, here the primary use case is
#  to receive notifications of changes to entries so we can disseminate that
#  information or act on it.
#
#  Note: Each of the three implementations of LDAP synchronisation behave
#  differently:
#
#  RFC 4533
#  --------
#  This provides a robust mechanism to allow clients to maintain a
#  cached copy of a fragment of a directory by the use of cookies which
#  can be returned to the server indicating the last successfully processed
#  updates from the server.
#
#  However, when an object is deleted from the directory, the entry which is
#  received only contains the DN, or, if the deletion is reported as part of
#  the initial refresh phase it may only be the UUID.
#
#  Active Direcory
#  ---------------
#  Active Directory will only provide updates from the time the query started;
#  there is no mechanism to catch up on changes which occured while the
#  client was not connected.  In addition it is not possible to apply a
#  filter to the query so that only a subset of objects are considered.
#
#  If notification is required when objects are deleted, then the Recycle Bin
#  has to be enabled on Active Directory and a query must be running which
#  includes the Deleted Objects container.
#
#  Active Directory will only perform persistent searches if the filter is
#  (objectClass=*).  To overcome this limitation, FreeRADIUS allows other
#  LDAP filters to be specified which are applied in FreeRADIUS before passing
#  packets to the relevant processing sections.
#
#  This implementation of LDAP filters is not intended to be complete, but
#  covers the most likely to be required.
#
#  One key limitation, due to not having the LDAP schema to interpret attribute
#  types, is that >=, <= and bitwise filters are assumed to be on integer values.
#
#  If your Active Directory tree contains multiple domains, you will need a
#  query for each domain that is of interest; running a query at the base
#  of the tree with a scope of "sub" does not include any domains other than
#  the base.
#
#  Depending on the attributes of interest, the number of notifications of
#  changes received can be reduced by running the LDAP query against the
#  Global Catalog rather than the normal AD LDAP server.
#
#  Persistent Search
#  -----------------
#  Servers implementing Persistent Search have the option to return the full
#  directory contents, or simply start reporting changes from the point when
#  the query was run.
#
#  The draft says that servers SHOULD include a changeNumber when reporting
#  changes to keep track of progress - however this has not been observed in
#  any testing.  If this is implemented, then it can behave in a similar
#  manner to the cookie defined in RFC 4533; a search against the change log
#  with a filter of (changeNumber>=n) could be used to read changes since
#  change number 'n'.
#
#
#  Note on user group membership
#  -----------------------------
#  Many directories provide a virtual memberOf attribute which lists
#  which groups a user is a member of.
#
#  With the directories which have been tested, including OpenLDAP and
#  Active Directory it has been observed that modifying group member lists
#  does not result in notification of changes to the users, even though
#  other modifications to the user will result in a notification which
#  can include the memberOf attribute.
#
#  Instead group membeship changes are reported as changes to the group object.
#
#
#  Each virtual-server may have multiple listen sections, with each
#  listen section containing multiple sync sections.
#
#  The listen section represents a single connection, and a sync represents
#  a single persistent search.
#
#  Most options within the listen section are identical to rlm_ldap.
#  See /etc/raddb/mods-available/ldap for more detailed descriptions of
#  configuration items.

		#  When directories provide cookies to track progress through

			scope = 'sub'

			#
			#  Specify a map of LDAP attributes to FreeRADIUS dictionary attributes.
			#
			#  The result of this map determines how attriubtes from the LDAP
			#  query are presented in the requests processed by the various
			#  "recv" sections below.
			#
			#  This is a very limited form of map:
			#   - the left hand side must be an attribute reference.
			#   - the right hand side is LDAP attributes which will be
			#     included in the query.
			#   - only = and += are valid operators with = setting a
			#     single instance of the attriubte and += setting as
			#     many as the LDAP query returns.
			#
			#  Protocol specific attributes must be qualified e.g. &Proto.radius.User-Name
			#
			update {
				&Proto.radius.User-Name = 'uid'
				&Password.With-Header = 'userPassword'
			}
		}

#		sync {
#			base_dn = "ou=groups,dc=example,dc=com"
#			filter = "(objectClass=groupOfNames)"
#			scope = "sub"

			#
			#  Since there are likely to be multiple members of
			#  a given group, the += operator should be used when
			#  defining a mapping of LDAP attribute "member" to
			#  FreeRADIUS attributes.
			#
#			update {
#				&Tmp-String-0 += "member"
#			}
#		}

		#
		#  If you are querying Active Directory, you are likely to
		#  want two queries.
		#
		#  It should be noted that Active Directory will only respond
		#  to queries with the LDAP_SERER_NOTIFICATION_OID control if
		#  the filter is (objectClass=*) - any other filter will result
		#  in an error.
		#
		#  To overcome this limitation, a subset of LDAP filter handling
		#  has been implemented in FreeRADIUS allowing a filter to be
		#  specified in this configuration.  The key limitation is
		#  <=, >= and bitwise filters assume attributes are numeric.
		#
		#  The only extensible match filters supported are the Active
		#  Directory bitwise AND and OR.
		#
		#  A suitable filter, to only receive notificaitons regarding
		#  normal user accounts could be:
		#
		#    (userAccountControl:1.2.840.113556.1.4.803:=512)
		#
		#  In addition, there is nothing returned by Active Directory to
		#  distinguish between an object being added or being modified.
		#  All LDAP entries which are returned are therefore processed
		#  through the recv Modify section when the directory is Active
		#  Directory.
		#
		#  By default Active Directory puts a limit of 5 on the number
		#  of persistent searches which can be active on a connection.
		#
		#  To determine if an object is enabled or disabled, the attribute
		#  userAccountControl can be evaluated.  This is returned as
		#  string data, so will want mapping to an integer attribute
		#  for processing.
		#
		#  Firstly, one based on a naming context which covers all
		#  user objects.  This will return results when objects are
		#  added, modified or restored from the Deleted Objects
		#  container.
		#
#		sync {
#			base_dn = 'cn=Users,dc=example,dc=com'
#			filter = '(userAccountControl:1.2.840.113556.1.4.803:=512)'
#			scope = 'sub'
#
#			update {
#				&Proto.radius.User-Name = 'sAMAccountName'
#				&Tmp-Integer-0 = 'userAccountControl'
#			}
#		}

		#
		#  Secondly, if you have the Recycle Bin enabled in Active
		#  Directory and wish to be notified about deleted objects,
		#  add a search covering the Deleted Objects container.
		#
		#  This will return results when an object is deleted, however
		#  the DN and CN of the object are changed.  The attribute
		#  lastKnownParent identifies where the object was deleted
		#  from.  However, lastKnownParent may not be returned when
		#  searching the Global Catalog.
		#
#		sync {
#			base_dn = "CN=Deleted Objects,dc=example,dc=com"
#			filter = '(userAccountControl:1.2.840.113556.1.4.803:=512)'
#			scope = "one"
#

	#
	#  This only applies to directories implementing RFC4533, such as OpenLDAP with

	#
	#  In addition the attribute &request.LDAP-Sync.Directory-Root-DN will be

	#  - If a sync experiences an error and needs to be restarted.
	#  - If a connection experiences an error and needs to be restarted.

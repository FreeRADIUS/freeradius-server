#  This virtual server simplifies the process of sending CoA-Request or
#  Disconnect-Request packets to a NAS.
#
#  This virtual server will receive CoA-Request or Disconnect-Request
#  packets that contain *minimal* identifying information.  e.g. Just
#  a User-Name, or maybe just an Acct-Session-Id attribute.  It will
#  look up that information in a database in order to find the rest of
#  the session data.  e.g. NAS-IP-Address, NAS-Identifier, NAS-Port,
#  etc.  That information will be added to the packet, which will then
#  be sent to the NAS.
#
#  This process is useful because NASes require the CoA packets to
#  contain "session identification" attributes in order to to do CoA
#  or Disconnect.  If the attributes aren't in the packet, then the
#  NAS will NAK the request.  This NAK happens even if you ask to
#  disconnect "User-Name = bob", and there is only one session with a
#  "bob" active.
#
#  Using this virtual server makes the CoA or Disconnect process
#  easier.  Just tell FreeRADIUS to disconnect "User-Name = bob", and
#  FreeRADIUS will take care of adding the "session identification"
#  attributes.
#
#  The process is as follows:
#
#    - A CoA/Disconnect-Request is received by FreeRADIUS.
#    - The radacct table is searched for active sessions that match each of
#      the provided identifier attributes: User-Name, Acct-Session-Id. The
#      search returns the owning NAS and Acct-Unique-Id for the matching
#      session/s.
#    - We originate CoA/Disconenct-Requests containing the original content,
#      filtered as required, with session identification added, to the
#      corresponding NAS for each session.
#
#  This simplifies scripting directly against a set of NAS devices since a
#  script need only send a single CoA/Disconnect to FreeRADIUS which will
#  then:
#
#    - Lookup all active sessions belonging to a user, in the case that only a
#      User-Name attribute is provided in the request
#    - Populate all necessary session identifiers
#    - Handle routing of the request to the correct NAS, in the case of a
#      multi-NAS setup
#
#  For example, to disconnect a specific session:
#
#    $ echo 'Acct-Session-Id = "769df3 312343"' | \
#      radclient -t 15 127.0.0.1 disconnect testing123
#
#  To perform a CoA update of all active sessions belonging to a user:
#
#    $ cat <<EOF | radclient -t 15 127.0.0.1 coa testing123
#      User-Name = bob
#      Vendor-Specific.Cisco.AVPair = "subscriber:sub-qos-policy-out=q_out_uncapped"
#      EOF
#
#  In addition to configuring and activating this site, instances of the radius
#  client module must be created for each NAS, for example:
#
#      radius radius-originate-coa-192.0.2.1 {
#	      type = CoA-Request
#	      type = Disconnect-Request
#	      transport = udp
#	      udp {
#		      ipaddr = 192.0.2.1
#		      port = 1700
#		      secret = "testing123"
#	      }
#
#	      # We are "originating" these packets since including Proxy-State
#	      # may confuse the NAS
#	      originate = yes
#
#	      # Uncomment this to fire and forget, rather than wait and retry
#	      # replicate = yes
#      }
#
#  Refer to `mods-enabled/radius` as a detailed reference for configuring
#  client access to each NAS.

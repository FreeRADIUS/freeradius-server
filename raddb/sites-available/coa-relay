#
#  This virtual server simplifies the process of sending CoA-Request or
#  Disconnect-Request packets to a NAS.
#
#  This virtual server will receive CoA-Request or Disconnect-Request
#  packets that contain *minimal* identifying information.  e.g. Just
#  a User-Name, or maybe just an Acct-Session-Id attribute.  It will
#  look up that information in a database in order to find the rest of
#  the session data.  e.g. NAS-IP-Address, NAS-Identifier, NAS-Port,
#  etc.  That information will be added to the packet, which will then
#  be sent to the NAS.
#
#  This process is useful because NASes require the CoA packets to
#  contain "session identification" attributes in order to to do CoA
#  or Disconnect.  If the attributes aren't in the packet, then the
#  NAS will NAK the request.  This NAK happens even if you ask to
#  disconnect "User-Name = bob", and there is only one session with a
#  "bob" active.
#
#  Using this virtual server makes the CoA or Disconnect process
#  easier.  Just tell FreeRADIUS to disconnect "User-Name = bob", and
#  FreeRADIUS will take care of adding the "session identification"
#  attributes.
#
#  The process is as follows:
#
#    - A CoA/Disconnect-Request is received by FreeRADIUS.
#    - The radacct table is searched for active sessions that match each of
#      the provided identifier attributes: User-Name, Acct-Session-Id. The
#      search returns the owning NAS and Acct-Unique-Id for the matching
#      session/s.
#    - The original CoA/Disconnect-Request content is written to a detail file
#      with custom attributes representing the NAS and Acct-Session-Id.
#    - A detail reader follows the file and originates CoA/Disconenct-Requests
#      containing the original content, relayed to the corresponding NAS for
#      each session using the custom attributes.
#
#  This simplifies scripting directly against a set of NAS devices since a
#  script need only send a single CoA/Disconnect to FreeRADIUS which will
#  then:
#
#    - Lookup all active sessions belonging to a user, in the case that only a
#      User-Name attribute is provided in the request
#    - Handle routing of the request to the correct NAS, in the case of a
#      multi-NAS setup
#
#  For example, to disconnect a specific session:
#
#    $ echo 'Acct-Session-Id = "769df3 312343"' | \
#      radclient 127.0.0.1 disconnect testing123
#
#  To perform a CoA update of all active sessions belonging to a user:
#
#    $ cat <<EOF | radclient 127.0.0.1 coa testing123
#      User-Name = bob
#      Cisco-AVPair = "subscriber:sub-qos-policy-out=q_out_uncapped"
#      EOF
#
#  In addition to configuring and activating this site, a detail
#  writer module must be configured in mods-enabled:
#
#    detail detail_coa {
#        filename = ${radacctdir}/detail_coa
#        escape_filenames = no
#        permissions = 0600
#        header = "%t"
#        locking = yes
#    }
#


#  Listen on a local CoA port.
#
#  This uses the normal set of clients, with the same secret as for
#  authentication and accounting.

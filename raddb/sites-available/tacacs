		#  #### Access-Request subsection
		#
		#  This section contains configuration which is
		#  specific to processing `Access-Request` packets.
		#
		#  Similar sections can be added, but are not
		#  necessary for Accounting-Request (and other)
		#  packets.  At this time, there is no configuration
		#  needed for other packet types.
		#

			#
			#  log:: Logging configuration for TACACS+ authentication
			#

				#  `User-Name` attribute, as it was
				#  found in the request.
				#
				#  allowed values: {no, yes}

				#
				#  auth:: Log authentication requests
				#  to the log file.
				#
				#  allowed values: {no, yes}

				#  passwords with the authentication
				#  requests.

				#  passwords with the authentication
				#  requests.

				#  allowed values: {no, yes}
				#
				auth_badpass = no

				#
				#  msg_goodpass::
				#  msg_badpass::
				#
				#  Log additional text at the end of the "Login OK" messages.
				#  for these to work, the "auth" and "auth_goodpass" or "auth_badpass"
				#  configurations above have to be set to "yes".
				#
				#  The strings below are dynamically expanded, which means that

			#  session:: Controls how ongoing
			#  (multi-round) sessions are handled

			#  This section is primarily useful for EAP.

			#  concurrently.

				#  This is only enforced for `Authentication-Type = ASCII`, when
				#  the server replies with `GetUser` or `GetPass` or `GetData`.
				#
				#  Some broken clients will send packets in a loop, forever.
				#  This configuration helps to catch and prevent that.
				#
				max_rounds = 4

				#
				#  timeout:: How long to wait before expiring a
				#  session.
				#
				#  The timer starts when a response
				#  with a state value is sent.  The
				#  timer stops when a request
				#  containing the previously sent
				#  state value is received.

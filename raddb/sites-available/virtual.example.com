#  You will want to edit this to your local needs.  We suggest copying
#  the text from the "default" file here, and then editing the text.
#  That way, any changes to the "default" file will not affect this
#  virtual server, and vice-versa.
#
#  When this virtual server receives the request, the original
#  attributes can be accessed as "outer.request", "outer.control", etc.
#  See "man unlang" for more details.
#

#
#  This example virtual server will listen on alternate ports
#  and perform basic authentication and accounting.
#  Consult the default file for information on the syntax and available options.
#

server virtual.example.com {

	#  In v4, all "server" sections MUST start with a "namespace"
	#  parameter.  This tells the server which protocol is being used.
	#  Consult the sites-available/default for more information and documentation.

	# Define our listeners and the types of application packets we expect.

	listen {
		type = Accounting-Request

		transport = udp

			port = 11813

	# Now we define our policy framework for how this virtual server will handle various application packets.
	# Consult the default file for information on the syntax and available options.

#
#	Sample configuration file for dynamically updating the list
#	of RADIUS clients at run time.
#
#	Everything is keyed off a client "network" (for example,
#	192.168.0.2/24). This configuration lets the server know
#	that clients within that network are defined dynamically.
#
#	When the server receives a packet from an unknown IP address
#	within that network, it tries to find a dynamic definition
#	for that client.  If the definition is found, the IP address
#	(and other configuration) is added to the server's internal
#	cache of "known clients", with a configurable lifetime.
#
#	Further packets from that IP address result in the client
#	definition being found in the cache.  Once the lifetime is
#	reached, the client definition is deleted, and any new requests
#	from that client are looked up as above.
#
#	If the dynamic definition is not found, then the request is
#	treated as if it came from an unknown client, i.e. it is
#	silently discarded.
#
#	The server has a negative cache for denied dynamic clients.
#	Once a client is denied, it is added to the negative cache,
#	and all packets from that source IP are rejected for 30s.

#  This virtual server is an EXAMPLE, and should not be enabled as-is.
#
#  To enable dynamic clients in an existing virtual server, copy
#  the "dynamic_clients" sub-section of the "udp" listener from
#  the below example. Then copy the "new client", "add client",
#  and "deny client" sub-sections into the virtual server.
#
#  When clients are added to a listener, they exist ONLY for that
#  listener.  Dynamic clients can process packets ONLY through the
#  virtual server in which they are defined.  Unlike v3, you CANNOT
#  define a global client, and point it to a different virtual server,
#
server dynamic_clients {
	#
	#  See the "default" virtual server for examples of how to
	#  configure a "listen" section.  Only the "dynamic_clients"
	#  changes are documented here.

				#
				#  The following configuration items

				#  attacks.  If the list of networks
				#  above include the open Internet,
				#  then these limits should be set as
				#  low as possible.

				#  If the list of networks above is
				#  limited to secure and local

				#  clients which will be allocated.
				#  This should be set to the smallest

				#
				max_clients = 65536

				#  time.  For security and DoS issues,
				#  this should be limited to a small

				max_pending_clients = 256

				#
				#  While the server is trying to
				#  define a new client, it may receive
				#  more than one packet from that
				#  client.  These packets are placed
				#  onto a "pending" queue until the
				#  client is defined (or not).
				#
				#  If the client is defined, the
				#  packets are processed as normal.
				#
				#  If the client is not defined, the
				#  packets are discarded.
				#
				#  This configuration item allows
				#  administrators to protect the
				#  server against DoS attacks, by
				#  limiting the number of pending
				#  packets.

				#
				#  Lifetime of the dynamic client.
				#  Allowed values are 600..86400.
				#
				#  When a client expires, it is NOT
				#  deleted immediately.  Instead, the
				#  server waits until all outstanding
				#  packets have been processed before
				#  deleting the client.
				#
				#  If there is a steady stream of
				#  packets from the dynamic client,
				#  Then the client is *renewed* every
				#  'lifetime' seconds.
				#
				#  What this means is that the old
				#  packets are still processed, and
				#  replies are sent.  But new packets
				#  are placed onto a "pending" queue.
				#
				#  If the client is defined the same
				#  as previously, then the lifetime is
				#  extended, and the pending packets
				#  are processed.
				#
				#  If the client is not renewed, then
				#  the pending packets are discarded.

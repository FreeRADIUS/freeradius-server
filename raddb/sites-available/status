#
#	A virtual server to handle ONLY Status-Server packets.
#
#	Server statistics can be queried with a properly formatted
#	Status-Server request.  See dictionary.freeradius for comments.
#
#	If radiusd.conf has "status_server = yes", then any client
#	will be able to send a Status-Server packet to any port
#	(listen section type "auth", "acct", or "status"), and the
#	server will respond.
#
#	If radiusd.conf has "status_server = no", then the server will
#	ignore Status-Server packets to "auth" and "acct" ports.  It
#	will respond only if the Status-Server packet is sent to a
#	"status" port.
#
#	The server statistics are available ONLY on socket of type
#	"status".  Queries for statistics sent to any other port
#	are ignored.
#
#	Similarly, a socket of type "status" will not process
#	authentication or accounting packets.  This is for security.

	#  i.e. NOT your NASes or Access Points, and for an ISP,
	#  DEFINITELY not any RADIUS servers that are proxying packets
	#  to you.
	#
	#  If you do NOT list a client here, then any client that is
	#  globally defined (i.e. all of them) will be able to query
	#  these statistics.
	#
	#  Do you really want your partners seeing the internal details
	#  of what your RADIUS server is doing?

}

#	Statistics can be queried via a number of methods:
#
#	All packets received/sent by the server (1 = auth, 2 = acct)
#		Vendor-Specific.FreeRADIUS.Stats4-Type = Global
#
#	All packets for a particular client (globally defined)
#		Vendor-Specific.FreeRADIUS.Stats4-Type = Client
#		Vendor-Specific.FreeRADIUS.Stats4-IPv4-Address = 192.0.2.1
#
#	All packets for a client attached to a "listen" ip/port
#		Vendor-Specific.FreeRADIUS.Stats4-Type = Listener
#		Vendor-Specific.FreeRADIUS.Stats4-IPv4-Address = 192.0.2.1
#		Vendor-Specific.FreeRADIUS.Stats4-port = 1812
#

#
#  Due to internal limitations, the statistics might not be exactly up
#  to date.  Do not expect all of the numbers to add up perfectly.

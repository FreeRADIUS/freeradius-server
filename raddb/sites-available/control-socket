#  = Control socket interface.
#
#	In the future, we will add username/password checking for
#	connections to the control socket.  We will also add
#	command authorization, where the commands entered by the
#	administrator are run through a virtual server before
#	they are executed.
#
#	For now, anyone who has permission to connect to the socket
#	has nearly complete control over the server.  Be warned!
#
#	NOTE: This functionality is NOT enabled by default.
#
#	See also the "radmin" program, which is used to communicate
#	with the server over the control socket.

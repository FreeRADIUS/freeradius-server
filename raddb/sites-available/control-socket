#  = Control socket interface.
#
#	In the future, we will add username/password checking for
#	connections to the control socket.  We will also add
#	command authorization, where the commands entered by the
#	administrator are run through a virtual server before
#	they are executed.
#
#	For now, anyone who has permission to connect to the socket
#	has nearly complete control over the server.  Be warned!
#
#	NOTE: This functionality is NOT enabled by default.
#
#	See also the "radmin" program, which is used to communicate
#	with the server over the control socket.

			#  Most operating systems (other than Linux), do not respect

			#
			#  To work around this issue, we ensure the
			#  permissions on the directory containing the socket,
			#  are sufficiently restrictive to only allow access
			#  by the FreeRADIUS user, or the gid below (if set).
			#
			#  It is recommended to house the socket in its own
			#  sub-directory.  FreeRADIUS will create this sub-directory
			#  if it doesn't exist and set the appropriate ownership and
			#  permissions.
			#

			#
			#  peercred:: It is enabled by default, and offers an additional layer
			#  of security.  When enabled FreeRADIUS will check the euid and
			#  egid of the process connecting to the control socket.
			#
			#  The client process is allowed to connect if any of the following
			#  are true:
			#
			#  - The client processes' euid is 0 (root).
			#  - The client processes' euid matches FreeRADIUS' euid.
			#  - gid is set (below), and the client processes' egid matches the
			#    configured gid.
			#
			#  NOTE: With peercred enabled, auxiliary groups of the client process
			#  are not considered.  If you have multiple users and need to control
			#  control socket authorization via group membership, you should set
			#  `peercred = no`, and rely on filesystem permissions for enforcement.

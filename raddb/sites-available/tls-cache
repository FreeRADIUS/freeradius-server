#
#  This virtual server controls caching of TLS sessions.
#
#  When a TLS session is used, the server will automatically create
#  the following attributes in the request list.  These attributes
#  are the the ones for the *server* certificate.
#
#	       TLS-Cert-Serial
#	       TLS-Cert-Expiration
#	       TLS-Cert-Subject
#	       TLS-Cert-Issuer
#	       TLS-Cert-Common-Name
#	       TLS-Cert-Subject-Alt-Name-Email
#
#  If a client certificate is required (e.g. EAP-TLS or sometimes PEAP / TTLS),
#  the following attributes are also created in the request list:
#
#	       TLS-Client-Cert-Serial
#	       TLS-Client-Cert-Expiration
#	       TLS-Client-Cert-Subject
#	       TLS-Client-Cert-Issuer
#	       TLS-Client-Cert-Common-Name
#	       TLS-Client-Cert-Subject-Alt-Name-Email

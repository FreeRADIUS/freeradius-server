#
#	This is a virtual server that handles DHCP.
#
#		!!!! WARNING !!!!
#
#	This code is experimental, and SHOULD NOT be used in a
#	production system.  It is intended for validation and
#	experimentation ONLY.
#
#	In order for this to work, you will need to run configure:
#
#		$ ./configure --with-dhcp
#		$ make
#		$ vi share/dictionary
#
#	## Un-comment the line containing $INCLUDE dictionary.dhcp
#	## Then, save the file.
#
#		$ make install
#
#	DHCP is NOT enabled by default.
#
#	The goal of this effort is to get the code in front of
#	people who are interested in another DHCP server.
#	We NEED FEEDBACK, patches, bug reports, etc.  Especially patches!
#
#	Please contribute, or this work will be nothing more than
#	a curiosity.
#
#
#	Q: What does it do?
#	A: It allows the server to receive DHCP packets, and to
#	   respond with static, pre-configured DHCP responses.
#
#	Q: Does it do static/dynamic IP assignment?
#	A: No.  Or, maybe.  Try it and see.
#
#	Q: Does it read ISC configuration or lease files?
#	A: No.  Please submit patches.
#
#	Q: Does it have DHCP feature X?
#	A: No.  Please submit patches.
#
#	Q: Does it support option 82?
#	A: Yes.
#
#	Q: Does it support other options?
#	A: Maybe.  See dictionary.dhcp.  Please submit patches.
#
#	Q: It doesn't seem to do much of anything!
#	A: Exactly.

#  The DHCP functionality goes into a virtual server.
#
server dhcp {

#  Define a DHCP socket.
#
#  The default port below is 6700, so you don't break your network.
#  If you want it to do real DHCP, change this to 67, and good luck!
#
#  You can also bind the DHCP socket to an interface.
#  See below, and raddb/radiusd.conf for examples.
#
#  This lets you run *one* DHCP server instance and have it listen on
#  multiple interfaces, each with a separate policy.
#
#  If you have multiple interfaces, it is a good idea to bind the
#  listen section to an interface.  You will also need one listen
#  section per interface.
#
#  FreeBSD does *not* support binding sockets to interfaces.  Therefore,
#  if you have multiple interfaces, broadcasts may go out of the wrong
#  one, or even all interfaces.  The solution is to use the "setfib" command.
#  If you have a network "10.10.0/24" on LAN1, you will need to do:
#
#  Pick any IP on the 10.10.0/24 network
#	$ setfib 1 route add default 10.10.0.1
#
#  Edit /etc/rc.local, and add a line:
#	setfib 1 /path/to/radiusd
#
#  The kern must be built with the following options:
#	options    ROUTETABLES=2
#  or any value larger than 2.
#
# The other only solution is to update FreeRADIUS to use BPF sockets.
#

	#  So that we only specify these values once, and then
	#  use them in all of the listen sections.
	port = 6700
	ipaddr = 127.0.0.1

	#  When the machine is not Linux, or has only one network
	#  interface, use the following listener.  It receives
	#  broadcast *and* unicast packets.
	listen {

		port = ${..port}

		# The DHCP server defaults to allowing broadcast packets.
		# Set this to "no" only when the server receives *all* packets
		# from a relay agent.  i.e. when *no* clients are on the same
		# LAN as the DHCP server.
		#
		# It's set to "no" here for testing.
		broadcast = no

	# the following two listeners instead of the one above.

	}

	#  Listen for unicasts on an IP, but not bound to any interface.
	#  This allows Linux systems to receive packets on interface X
	#  when the IP is associated with interface Y.
	#
	#  Then, define which interface the packets go out of, via
	#  "arp_interface".  This means that the outbound packets
	#  get sent via the correct interface.

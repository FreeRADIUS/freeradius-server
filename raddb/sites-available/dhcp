#  The DHCP functionality goes into a virtual server.
#
server dhcp {
	namespace = dhcpv4

#  Define a DHCP socket.
#
#  The default port below is 6700, so you don't break your network.
#  If you want it to do real DHCP, change this to 67, and good luck!
#
#  You can also bind the DHCP socket to an interface.
#  See below, and raddb/radiusd.conf for examples.
#
#  This lets you run *one* DHCP server instance and have it listen on
#  multiple interfaces, each with a separate policy.
#
#  If you have multiple interfaces, it is a good idea to bind the
#  listen section to an interface.  You will also need one listen
#  section per interface.
#
listen {
	type = DHCP-Discover
	type = DHCP-Decline

	transport = udp

	udp {
		#  IP address to listen on. Will usually be the IP of the
		#  interface, or 0.0.0.0
		ipaddr = 127.0.0.1

		#  The port should be 67 for a production network. Don't set
		#  it to 67 on a production network unless you really know
		#  what you're doing. Even if nothing is configured below, the
		#  server may still NAK legitimate responses from clients.
		port = 6700

		#  Interface name we are listening on. See comments above.
#		interface = lo0

		#  source IP address for unicast packets sent by the
		#  DHCP server.
		#
		#  The source IP for unicast packets is chosen from the first
		#  one of the following items which returns a valid IP
		#  address:
		#
		#       src_ipaddr
		#       ipaddr
		#       reply:DHCP-Server-IP-Address
		#       reply:DHCP-DHCP-Server-Identifier
		#
		src_ipaddr = 127.0.0.1

		# The DHCP server defaults to allowing broadcast packets.
		# Set this to "no" only when the server receives *all* packets
		# from a relay agent.  i.e. when *no* clients are on the same
		# LAN as the DHCP server.
		#
		# It's set to "no" here for testing. It will usually want to
		# be "yes" in production, unless you are only dealing with
		# relayed packets.
		broadcast = no

		# On Linux if you're running the server as non-root, you
		# will need to do:
		#
		#	sudo setcap cap_net_admin=ei /path/to/radiusd
		#
		# This will allow the server to set ARP table entries
		# for newly allocated IPs
	}

}

#  Packets received on the socket will be processed through one
#  of the following sections, named after the DHCP packet type.
#  See dictionary.dhcpv4 for the packet types.

#  Return packets will be sent to, in preference order:
#     DHCP-Gateway-IP-Address
#     DHCP-Client-IP-Address
#     DHCP-Your-IP-Address
#  At least one of these attributes should be set at the end of each
#  section for a response to be sent.

recv DHCP-Discover {

	#  Set the type of packet to send in reply.
	#
	#  The server will look at the DHCP-Message-Type attribute to
	#  determine which type of packet to send in reply. Common
	#  values would be DHCP-Offer, DHCP-Ack or DHCP-NAK. See
	#  dictionary.dhcp for all the possible values.
	#
	#  DHCP-Do-Not-Respond can be used to tell the server to not
	#  respond.
	#
	#  In the event that DHCP-Message-Type is not set then the
	#  server will fall back to determining the type of reply
	#  based on the rcode of this section.

#  WARNING: This configuration file has not been updated for v4,
#            and therefore WILL NOT WORK.  Please do not use it.
#
#	This is a sample configuration for robust proxy accounting.
#	accounting packets are proxied, OR logged locally if all
#	home servers are down.  When the home servers come back up,
#	the accounting packets are forwarded.
#
#	This method enables the server to proxy all packets to the
#	home servers when they're up, AND to avoid writing to the
#	detail file in most situations.
#
#	In most situations, proxying of accounting messages is done
#	in a "pass-through" fashion.  If the home server does not
#	respond, then the proxy server does not respond to the NAS.
#	That means that the NAS must retransmit packets, sometimes
#	forever.  This example shows how the proxy server can still
#	respond to the NAS, even if all home servers are down.
#
#	This configuration could be done MUCH more simply if ALL
#	packets were written to the detail file.  But that would
#	involve a lot more disk writes, which may not be a good idea.
#
#	NOTE: This file is NOT meant to be used as-is.  It needs to be
#	edited to match your local configuration.

	#  Read accounting packets from the detail file(s) for
	#  the home server.

	#  Note that you can have only ONE "listen" section reading
	#  detail files from a particular directory.  That is why the
	#  destination host name is used as part of the directory name
	#  below.  Having two "listen" sections reading detail files
	#  from the same directory WILL cause problems.  The packets
	#  may be read by one, the other, or both "listen" sections.

	#  reading the detail file, and queues the packets for a later
	#  retransmission.  The Post-Proxy-Type "Fail" handler is NOT
	#  called.
	#
	#  When the home servers come back up, the packets are forwarded,

#  = ARP Virtual Server
#
#  This is a virtual server that handles ARP.
#
#  It allows the administrator to log ARP packets on the
#  local network.  The idea is that the ARP packets can be
#  checked against a database (e.g. DHCP), or stored in
#  an ARP-specific database.  If something funny is
#  going on, it can produce syslog messages informing the
#  administrator.
#
#  See `arpwatch` for examples of what it should do.   For now,
#  this is just a toy example.
#
#  NOTE: It NEVER sends an ARP packet.
#

#
#  # Example configuration
#

#
#  ## server arp { ... }
#
#  This is the default `arp` virtual server.
#
server arp {
	#
	#  ### listen { ... }
	#
	#  Please see `listen` for more.
	#
	listen {
		#
		#  type:: ARP is type arp.
		#
		type = arp

		#
		#  interface:: The only configuration possible for ARP
		#  is the name of the interface.
		#
		interface = en1
	}

	#
	#  ### arp { ... }
	#
	#  If you need to know the interface, use `%{listen:interface}`
	#
	arp {
		ok
	}
}

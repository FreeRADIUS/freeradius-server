#  Sample virtual server for receiving a CoA or Disconnect-Request packet.

#  This uses the normal set of clients, with the same secret as for
#  authentication and accounting.

	#  Disconnect-Request packets.

		#  CoA && Disconnect packets can be proxied in the same
		#  way as authentication or accounting packets.
		#  Just set Proxy-To-Realm, or Home-Server-Pool, and the
		#  packets will be proxied.

		#  Do proxying based on realms here.  You don't need
		#  "IPASS" or "ntdomain", as the proxying is based on
		#  the Operator-Name attribute.  It contains the realm,
		#  and ONLY the realm (prefixed by a '1')
		suffix

		#  Insert your own policies here.
		ok

	#  When a packet is sent, it is processed through the
	#  send-coa section.  This applies to *both* CoA-Request and
	#  Disconnect-Request packets.

		#  Sample module.
		ok

	#  You can use pre-proxy and post-proxy sections here, too.
	#  They will be processed for sending && receiving proxy packets.

#  This next section is here to allow testing of the "inner-tunnel"
#  authentication methods, independently from the "default" server.
#  It is listening on "localhost", so that it can only be used from
#  the same machine.
#
#      $ radtest USER PASSWORD 127.0.0.1:18120 0 testing123
#
#  If it works, you have configured the inner tunnel correctly.  To check
#  if PEAP will work, use:
#
#      $ radtest -t mschap USER PASSWORD 127.0.0.1:18120 0 testing123
#
#  If that works, PEAP should work.  If that command doesn't work, then
#
#      FIX THE INNER TUNNEL CONFIGURATION SO THAT IT WORKS.
#
#  Do NOT do any PEAP tests.  It won't help.  Instead, concentrate
#  on fixing the inner tunnel configuration.  DO NOTHING ELSE.

	#  The example below uses module failover to avoid querying all
	#  of the following modules if the EAP module returns "ok".

	#  will then see that password, and use it to do PAP
	#  authentication.

#  Authentication.
#
#
#  This section lists which modules are available for authentication.
#  Note that it does NOT mean 'try each module in order'.  It means
#  that a module from the 'authorize' section adds a configuration
#  attribute 'Auth-Type := FOO'.  That authentication type is then
#  used to pick the appropriate module from the list below.
#

#  In general, you SHOULD NOT set the Auth-Type attribute.  The server
#  will figure it out on its own, and will do the right thing.  The
#  most common side effect of erroneously setting the Auth-Type
#  attribute is that one authentication method will work, but the
#  others will not.
#
#  The common reasons to set the Auth-Type attribute by hand
#  is to either forcibly reject the user, or forcibly accept him.
#
#  NB You cannot forcibly accept an EAP authentication!

#
#  PAP authentication, when a back-end database listed
#  in the 'authorize' section supplies a password.  The
#  password can be clear-text, or encrypted.
authenticate pap {
	pap
}

#
#  Most people want CHAP authentication
#  A back-end database listed in the 'authorize' section
#  MUST supply a CLEAR TEXT password.  Encrypted passwords
#  won't work.
authenticate chap {
	chap

#
#  MSCHAP authentication.

#  Pluggable Authentication Modules.
#authenticate pam {

#  Uncomment it if you want to use ldap for authentication
#
#  Note that this means "check plain-text password against
#  the ldap database", which means that EAP won't work,
#  as it does not supply a plain-text password.
#
#  We do NOT recommend using this.  LDAP servers are databases.
#  They are NOT authentication servers.  FreeRADIUS is an
#  authentication server, and knows what to do with authentication.
#  LDAP servers do not.

#  Post-Authentication
#  Once we KNOW that the user has been authenticated, there are
#  additional steps we can take.
#
#  Note that the last packet of the inner-tunnel authentication
#  MAY NOT BE the last packet of the outer session.  So updating
#  the outer reply MIGHT work, and sometimes MIGHT NOT.  The
#  exact functionality depends on both the inner and outer
#  authentication methods.
#
#  If you need to send a reply attribute in the outer session,
#  the ONLY safe way is to update the outer session-state.
#  Attributes that should be provided in the reply should be
#  copied to the outer.session-state list:
#
#      update outer.session-state {
#          ...
#      }
#
#  The default configuration in the outer post-auth "send" section
#  will copy this to the reply. To copy the entire reply see
#  "use_tunneled_reply" below.
#
send Access-Accept {
	#  If you want privacy to remain, see the
	#  Chargeable-User-Identity attribute from RFC 4372.
	#  If you want to use it just uncomment the line below.
#       cui-inner

	#
	#  If you want to have a log of authentication replies,
	#  uncomment the following line, and enable the
	#  'detail reply_log' module.
#	reply_log

	#
	#  After authenticating the user, do another SQL query.
	#
	#  See "Authentication Logging Queries" in `mods-config/sql/main/$driver/queries.conf`
	-sql

	#
	#  Instead of sending the query to the SQL server,
	#  write it into a log file.

	#  'edir = yes' in the ldap module sub-section of
	#  the 'modules' section.

#	ldap

	#
	#  Instead of the "use_tunneled_reply" option in previous
	#  versions of the server, uncomment the following line to
	#  copy reply attributes from the inner-tunnel back to the
	#  outer session-state. The outer "send Access-Accept"
	#  section will then copy them from the session-state into
	#  the reply.

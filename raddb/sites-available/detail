server detail {
	#
	#  In v4, all "server" sections MUST start with a "namespace"
	#  parameter.  This tells the server which protocol is being used.
	#
	#  All of the subsequent "listen" sections in this server will
	#  only accept packets for that protocol.
	#
	namespace = detail

	listen {
		#
		#  The packet types are NOT in the detail file,
		#  so they need to be listed here.
		#
		#  Supported types are:
		#
		#  Accounting-Request
		#  CoA-Request
		#  Disconnect-Request
		#
		type = Accounting-Request

		#
		#  What transports are being used to read detail
		#  files.  For now, only "file" is supported.
		#
		#  Future releases will allow reading "detail"
		#  style information from sockets or streams.
		#
		transport = file

		#
		#  Unlike v3, there is no "load_factor" configuration.
		#
		#  Instead, the detail file listener is "self
		#  clocking".  The listener reads one entry, and as
		#  soon as it gets a response to that entry, the
		#  listener reads a second entry.
		#
		#  Packets from the detail listener are low priority,
		#  so they are procesed only when there is nothing
		#  else to do.  i.e. if the server receives many
		#  Access-Request or Accounting-Request packets from
		#  the network, they will be processed *before* any
		#  packets from the detail file.
		#
		#  This behavior ensures that the detail file is read
		#  as fast as possible.  At the same time, it ensures
		#  that the detail file does not affect higher
		#  priority packets from the network.
		#

		#
		#  Set the priority for packets from the detail
		#  listener.  For safety, it should be set low.  This
		#  means that "real" packets from a NAS will be
		#  processed before packets from the detail listener.
		#
		#  i.e. the packets from the detail listener won't be
		#  processed until ALL OTHER packets in the system
		#  have been received, processed, and responded to.
		#
		#  The default is for the server to process packets in
		#  the following priority:
		#
		#	Status-Server
		#	Access-Request
		#	Disconnect-Request
		#	CoA-Request
		#	Accounting-Request
		#	packets from the "detail" listener.
		#
		#  This priority setting ensures that the server will
		#  be responsive and stable.
		#
		#  Allowed values: 1 to 65536.
		#
		#  Setting it to "1" means "very low priority".
		#
		#  Setting it to "65536" means "higher priority than
		#  Access-Request packet"
		#
#		priority = 1

		#
		#  Check for the existence of detail files.
		#
		#  You MUST also configure a "work" subsection below.

			#  As of v4, you can have multiple detail file
			#  readers in the same directory.  The only

			#  The best way to enforce that is to give the

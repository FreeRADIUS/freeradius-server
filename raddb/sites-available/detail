virtual_server detail {
	#
	#  In v4, all "server" sections MUST start with a "namespace"
	#  parameter.  This tells the server which protocol is being used.
	#
	#  All of the subsequent "listen" sections in this server will
	#  only accept packets for that protocol.
	#
	namespace = detail

	listen {
		#
		#  The packet types are NOT in the detail file,
		#  so they need to be listed here.
		#
		#  Supported types are:
		#
		#  Accounting-Request
		#  CoA-Request
		#  Disconnect-Request
		#
		type = Accounting-Request

		#
		#  What transports are being used to read detail
		#  files.  For now, only "file" is supported.
		#
		#  Future releases will allow reading "detail"
		#  style information from sockets or streams.
		#
		transport = file

		#
		#  Unlike v3, there is no "load_factor" configuration.
		#
		#  Instead, the detail file listener is "self
		#  clocking".  The listener reads one entry, and as
		#  soon as it gets a response to that entry, the
		#  listener reads a second entry.
		#
		#  
		#

		#
		#  Set the priority for packets from the detail
		#  listener.  For safety, it should be set low.  This
		#  means that "real" packets from a NAS will be
		#  processed before packets from the detail listener.
		#
		#  i.e. the packets from the detail listener won't be
		#  processed until ALL OTHER packets in the system
		#  have been received, processed, and responded to.
		#
		#  The default is for the server to process packets in
		#  the following priority:
		#
		#	Status-Server
		#	Access-Request
		#	Disconnect-Request
		#	CoA-Request
		#	Accounting-Request
		#	packets from the "detail" listener.
		#
		#  This priority setting ensures that the server will
		#  be responsive and stable.
		#
		#  Allowed values: 1 to 65536.
		#
		#  Setting it to "1" means "very low priority".
		#
		#  Setting it to "65536" means "higher priority than
		#  Access-Request packet"
		#
#		priority = 1

		#
		#  Read from a "file".

			#
			#  The name of the current working file.
			#  If ommitted, it is the directory from
			#  the 'filename' above, with "/detail.work"
			#  appended to it.
			#
			#  As of v4, you can have multiple detail file
			#  readers in the same directory.  The only
			#  caveat is that the wildcards CANNOT overlap.
			#
			#  The best way to enforce that is to give the
			#  the files different prefixes.
			#
			filename.work = "${confdir}/detail.work"

			#
			#  Track progress through the detail file.  When the detail
			#  file is large, and the server is re-started, it will
			#  read from the START of the file.
			#
			#  Setting "track = yes" means it will skip packets which
			#  have already been processed.  The default is "no".
			#
			track = yes

			#
			#  If there are no detail files in the directory,
			#  the listener will periodically wake up to check
			#  for new entries.
			#
			#  Allowed values: 1 to 3600
			poll_interval = 5

			#
			#  The maximum size (in bytes) of one entry in
			#  the detail file.  If this setting is too
			#  low, then the "too large" entries in the
			#  detail file will be ignored.
			#
			#  Due to limitations in the detail file
			#  reader, if multiple entries fit into this
			#  size, then all of those entries will be
			#  read and processed, before further reading
			#  is done from the file.

				#  i.e. if any one of the limits is hit, the
				#  retransmission stops.
				#

				#
				#  Maximum Retransmit Count: 1..20

	#  If the "recv" section returns "ok" or "updated", it
	#  will run the "send ok" section to send the reply.
	#
	#  All other return codes (e.g. "fail") will cause it to run
	#  the "send fail" section.

#
#  All successful packets sent by the detail listener are processed through the

#
#  If the listener is configured with 'track = yes', then the entry in
#  the detail file is marked up as being "done".  Subsequent re-reads
#  of the same detail file (e.g. on server re-start) will skip the
#  "done" entries.

send ok {

}

#
#  All failed packets sent by the detail listener are processed through the
#  'send fail' section.  Note that the name is the same for all packet types.
#
#  If the listener is configured with 'track = yes', then the packet
#  will be retransmitted by the detail file reader, until the packet
#  returns "success".  See the "limit" subsection above for retransmission
#  configuration.

#  Note that unlike other listeners, there is no "send Do-Not-Respond"

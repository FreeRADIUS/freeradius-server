#
#	As of 2.0.0, FreeRADIUS supports virtual hosts using the
#	"server" section, and configuration directives.
#
#	Virtual hosts should be put into the "sites-available"
#	directory.  Soft links should be created in the "sites-enabled"
#	directory to these files.  This is done in a normal installation.
#
#	If you are using 802.1X (EAP) authentication, please see also
#	the "inner-tunnel" virtual server.  You wll likely have to edit
#	that, too, for authentication to work.
#
#	$Id$

######################################################################
#
#	Read "man radiusd" before editing this file.  See the section
#	titled DEBUGGING.  It outlines a method where you can quickly
#	obtain the configuration you want, without running into
#	trouble.  See also "man unlang", which documents the format
#	of this file.
#
#	This configuration is designed to work in the widest possible
#	set of circumstances, with the widest possible number of
#	authentication methods.  This means that in general, you should
#	need to make very few changes to this file.
#
#	The best way to configure the server for your local system
#	is to CAREFULLY edit this file.  Most attempts to make large
#	edits to this file will BREAK THE SERVER.  Any edits should
#	be small, and tested by running the server with "radiusd -X".
#	Once the edits have been verified to work, save a copy of these
#	configuration files somewhere.  (e.g. as a "tar" file).  Then,
#	make more edits, and test, as above.
#
#	There are many "commented out" references to modules such
#	as ldap, sql, etc.  These references serve as place-holders.
#	If you need the functionality of that module, then configure
#	it in radiusd.conf, and un-comment the references to it in
#	this file.  In most cases, those small changes will result
#	in the server being able to connect to the DB, and to
#	authenticate users.

#
#	In 1.x, the "authorize", etc. sections were global in
#	radiusd.conf.  As of 2.0, they SHOULD be in a server section.
#
#	The server section with no virtual server name is the "default"
#	section.  It is used when no server name is specified.

#	We don't indent the rest of this file, because doing so

#  we try to find a matching realm.

	#  attribute for authentication, the mschap module will find

	#  The example below uses module failover to avoid querying all

#  Authentication.
#
#
#  This section lists which modules are available for authentication.
#  Note that it does NOT mean 'try each module in order'.  It means
#  that a module from the 'authorize' section adds a configuration
#  attribute 'Auth-Type := FOO'.  That authentication type is then
#  used to pick the apropriate module from the list below.
#

#  In general, you SHOULD NOT set the Auth-Type attribute.  The server
#  will figure it out on its own, and will do the right thing.  The
#  most common side effect of erroneously setting the Auth-Type
#  attribute is that one authentication method will work, but the
#  others will not.
#
#  The common reasons to set the Auth-Type attribute by hand
#  is to either forcibly reject the user (Auth-Type := Reject),
#  or to or forcibly accept the user (Auth-Type := Accept).
#
#  Note that Auth-Type := Accept will NOT work with EAP.
#
#  Please do not put "unlang" configurations into the "authenticate"
#  section.  Put them in the "post-auth" section instead.  That's what
#  the post-auth section is for.

#
#  = The default Virtual Server
#
#  The `default` virtual server is the first one that is enabled on a
#  default installation of FreeRADIUS.  This configuration is
#  designed to work in the widest possible set of circumstances, with
#  the widest possible number of authentication methods.  This means
#  that in general, you should need to make very few changes to this
#  file.
#
#  The usual approach is as follows:
#
#  * configure users in a database (e.g. the `files` module, or in
#    `sql`)
#  * configure the relevant module to talk to the database
#    (e.g. `sql`)
#  * If using EAP / 802.1X, configure the certificates in
#    the `certs/` directory.
#
#  Then, run the server.  This process will ensure that users can log
#  in via PAP, CHAP, MS-CHAP, etc.  You should so test the server via
#  `radtest` to verify that it works.
#
#  == Editing this file
#
#  Please read "man radiusd" before editing this file.  See the
#  section titled DEBUGGING.  It outlines a method where you can
#  quickly obtain the configuration you want, without running into
#  trouble. And finally, the debug output can be complex. Please read
#  https://www.freeradius.org/documentation/freeradius-server/4.0.0/debugging/radiusd_X.html
#
#  The best way to configure the server for your local system is to
#  *carefully* edit this file.  Most attempts to make large edits to
#  this file will *break the server*.  Any edits should be small, and
#  tested by running the server with `radiusd -X`.  Once the edits
#  have been verified to work, save a copy of these configuration
#  files somewhere.  We recommend using a revision control system such
#  as `git`, or even a "tar" file.  Then, make more edits, and test,
#  as above.
#
#  There are many "commented out" references to modules and
#  configurations These references serve as place-holders, and as
#  documentation.  If you need the functionality of that module, then:
#
#  * configure the module in `mods-available/`
#  * enable the module in `mods-enabled/`.  e.g. for LDAP, do:  `cd mods-enabled;ln -s ../mods-available/ldap`
#  * uncomment the references to it in this file.
#
#  In most cases, those small changes will result in the server being
#  able to connect to the database, and to authenticate users.
#

#
#  == The Virtual Server
#
#  This is the `default` virtual server.
#
server default {
	#
	#  namespace:: The protocol namespace (i.e. dictionary) to use.
	#
	#  In v4, all "server" sections MUST start with a "namespace"
	#  parameter.  This tells the server which protocol is being used.
	#
	#  All of the "listen" sections in this virtual server will
	#  only accept packets for that protocol.
	#
	namespace = radius

	#
	#  log:: The name of the logging section to use.
	#
	#  The top configuration section can contain multiple section "log foo { ... }".
	#  Each of those sections is a different named logging destination.
	#
	#  This configuration item allows setting a different logging destination for an
	#  individual virtual server.
	#
	#  There are some limitations.
	#
	#  * this logging is in _addition_ to the default logging to "log { .... }".
	#  * it is not currently possible to _replace_ the default logging destination
	#  * the name given here _must_ be a fixed string, and is not dynamically expanded.
	#
#	log = some_other_logging_destination

	#
	#  ### RADIUS Configuration
	#
	#  All of the configuration for processing RADIUS packets goes here.
	#
	radius {
		#
		#  #### Access-Request subsection
		#
		#  This section contains configuration which is
		#  specific to processing `Access-Request` packets.
		#
		#  Similar sections can be added, but are not
		#  necessary for Accounting-Request (and other)
		#  packets.  At this time, there is no configuration
		#  needed for other packet types.
		#
		Access-Request {
			#
			#  session:: Controls how ongoing
			#  (multi-round) sessions are handled
			#
			#  This section is primarily useful for EAP.
			#  It controls the number of EAP
			#  authentication attempts that can occur
			#  concurrently.
			#
			session {
				#
				#  max:: The maximum number of ongoing sessions
				#
#				max = 4096


				#
				#  max_rounds:: The maximum number of message exchanges
				#  before the server gives up
				#
#				max_rounds = 40

				#
				#  timeout:: How long to wait before expiring a
				#  session.
				#
				#  The timer starts when a response
				#  with a state value is sent.  The
				#  timer stops when a request
				#  containing the previously sent
				#  state value is received.
				#
#				timeout = 15

				#
				#  dedup_key:: Key to enforce only one active session per
				#  supplicant.
				#
				#  Some supplicants may misbehave by starting many thousands
				#  of EAP sessions, but never finishing them.  These sessions
				#  can cause the server to hit 'max_sessions' very quickly.
				#  The 'timer_expire' configuration above does not help as
				#  much as it could, because the old (duplicate) session
				#  should be deleted as soon as the new one comes in.
				#
				#  If you set the 'dedup_key' below, whenever the EAP module
				#  starts a new session, it will check for a previous session
				#  which has the same dedup key.  If a previous session
				#  is found, it is deleted.
				#
				#  Setting this configuration item may cause issues if the
				#  same device uses multiple EAP sessions at the same time.
				#  But that device behavior should be rare to non-existent.
				#
				#  The configuration item is commented out so that upgrades
				#  do not change existing behavior.
				#
#				dedup_key = Calling-Station-Id
			}
		}

		#
		#  There is currently no configuration for other packet types.
		#
	}

	#
	#  ### Local Dictionaries
	#
	#  It is now possible to have dictionaries which are local to a virtual
	#  server.  The attributes defined here can be used in policies in this
	#  virtual server.
	#
	#  Any attribute defined in this section can only be used in policies in
	#  this virtual server.  The attributes are "internal", and cannot go
	#  into a packet which is sent on the network.
	#
	#  When a request is proxied internally to another virtual server, these
	#  attributes are still sent with the proxied request.  However, as the
	#  definitions do not exist in the other virtual server, they cannot be
	#  used in policies.
	#
	#  The other virtual server can even define attributes of the same name.
	#  That virtual server will use those definitions for its policies, and
	#  will never match the proxied attributes.
	#
	#  In all other aspects, the attributes defined here are just the same
	#  as if they had been assigned in a dictionary file.
	#
	dictionary {
		#
		#  The syntax is _<type>_ followed by _<name>_.
		#
		#  The _<type>_ MUST be a leaf type or a `group`.  i.e. not
		#  `struct`, `vsa`, or `vendor`.
		#
		#  The _<name>_ MUST NOT exist in the `namespace` dictionary.
		#
#		uint32 foo

		#
		#  tlv:: Define a TLV variable using _tlv <name> { ...}_.
		#
		#  The contents of the `tlv` subsection are more variable
		#  definitions, including child `tlv`s.
		#
#		tlv bar {
#		    uint32 baz
#		    string arg
#		}

		#
		#  values:: Define a set of values for attribute _<name>_.
		#
		#  The contents of the `values` section are a list of names and
		#  values.
		#
#		values foo {
			#
			#  _<name>_ = _<value>_
			#
			#  The _<name>_ must be unique.
			#
			#  The _<value>_ is parsed according to the data type of
			#  the attribute.
			#
#			bar = 1
#			baz = 2
#		}
	}


	#
	#  ### The listen section
	#
	#  The `listen` sections in v4 are very different from the
	#  `listen sections in v3.  The changes were necessary in
	#  order to make FreeRADIUS more flexible, and to make the
	#  configuration simpler and more consistent.
	#
	#  If there are multiple `listen` sections in the same
	#  virtual server, they need to be given a second name.
	#
	#  Listen sections are identified by virtual server name,
	#  then by the namespace, then by transport, finally by
	#  a second name.
	#
	listen authentication {
		#
		#  type:: The type of packet to accept.
		#
		#  Multiple types can be accepted by using multiple
		#  lines of `type = ...`.
		#
		#  This change from v3 makes it much clearer what kind
		#  of packet is being accepted.  The old `auth+acct`
		#  configuration was awkward and potentially
		#  confusing.
		#
		type = Access-Request
		type = Status-Server

		#
		#  transport:: The transport protocol.
		#
		#  The allowed transports for RADIUS are currently
		#  `udp` and `tcp`.  A `listen` section can only have
		#  one `transport` defined.  For multiple transports,
		#  use multiple `listen` sections.
		#
		#  You can have a "headless" server by commenting out
		#  the "transport" configuration.  A "headless" server
		#  will process packets from other virtual servers,
		#  but will not accept packets from the network.
		#
		#  The `inner-tunnel` server is an example of a
		#  headless server.  It accepts packets from the
		#  "inner tunnel" portion of PEAP and TTLS.  But it
		#  does not accept those packets from the network.
		#
		transport = udp

		#
		#  require_message_authenticator::Require Message-Authenticator
		#  in Access-Requests.
		#
		#  RFC 5080 suggests that all clients *should* include it in an
		#  Access-Request. The configuration item below allows the server
		#  to require it. If a client is required to include a `Message-Authenticator`
		#  and it does not, then the packet will be silently discarded.
		#
		#  If value is auto, then if any packet received from the client
		#  contains a valid Message-Authenticator attribute, then the server
		#  will require it from all future packets from that client.
		#
		#  Allowed values: yes, no, auto
		#
		#  The default is "no".
		#
		require_message_authenticator = auto

		#
		#  limit_proxy_state:: Control whether Proxy-State is allowed in
		#  packets from this client which do not have a Message-Authenticator.
		#
		#  The blastradius prefix attack allows an attacker to manipulate
		#  the contents of response packets without knowing the shared secret.
		#
		#  The attack relies on controlling a portion of the data sent back
		#  in the response by the RADIUS server. As Proxy-State is always
		#  echoed back verbatim from the request, it can be leveraged to
		#  manipulate the data sent back from the server and facilitate the
		#  attack.
		#
		#  The attack also relies on defficiencies in the original RADIUS
		#  standards that provided no integrity protection for Access-Requests.
		#
		#  The attack is mitigated by requiring the Message-Authenticator,
		#  which contains a HMAC over the entire request, preventing
		#  modification of the request by the attacker.
		#
		#  If value is auto, and the first packet received from the client
		#  does not contain a Proxy-State attribute, Proxy-State will be
		#  disallowed in any future packets which do not contain a
		#  Message-Authenticator.
		#
		#  This provides some level of protection against the blastradius
		#  attack, without requiring Message-Authenticator, or breaking
		#  existing deployments.
		#
		#  Allowed values: yes, no, auto
		#
		#  The default is "auto".
		#
		limit_proxy_state = auto

		#
		#  limit:: limits for this socket.
		#
		#  The `limit` section contains configuration items
		#  which enforce various limits on the socket.  These
		#  limits are usually transport-specific.
		#
		#  Limits are used to prevent "run-away" problems.
		#
		limit {
			#
			#  max_clients:: The maximum number of dynamic
			#  clients which can be defined for this
			#  listener.
			#
			#  If dynamic clients are not used, then this
			#  configuration item is ignored.
			#
			#  The special value of `0` means "no limit".
			#  We do not recommend using `0`, as attackers
			#  could forge packets from the entire
			#  Internet, and cause FreeRADIUS to run out
			#  of memory.
			#
			#  This configuration item should be set to
			#  the number of individual RADIUS clients
			#  (e.g. NAS, AP, etc.) which will be sending
			#  packets to FreeRADIUS.
			#
			max_clients = 256

			#
			#  max_connections:: The maximum number of
			#  connected sockets which will be accepted
			#  for this listener.
			#
			#  Each connection opens a new socket, so be
			#  aware of system file descriptor
			#  limitations.
			#
			#  If the listeners do not use connected
			#  sockets (e.g. TCP), then this configuration
			#  item is ignored.
			#
			max_connections = 256

			#
			#  idle_timeout:: Time after which idle
			#  connections are deleted.
			#
			#  Useful range of values: 5 to 600
			#
			idle_timeout = 60.0

			#
			#  dynamic_timeout:: Time after which idle
			#  dynamic clients are deleted.
			#
			dynamic_timeout = 600.0

			#
			#  nak_lifetime:: Time for which blocked
			#  clients are placed into a NAK cache.
			#
			#  If a dynamic client is disallowed, it is
			#  placed onto a "NAK" list for a period
			#  of time.  This process helps to prevent
			#  DoS attacks.  When subsequent packets are
			#  received from that IP address, they hit the
			#  "NAK" cache, and are immediately discarded.
			#
			#  After `nak_timeout` seconds, the blocked
			#  entry will be removed, and the IP will be
			#  allowed to try again to define a dynamic
			#  client.
			#
			#  Useful range of values: 1 to 600
			#
			nak_lifetime = 30.0

			#
			#  cleanup_delay:: The time to wait (in
			#  seconds) before cleaning up a reply to an
			#  `Access-Request` packet.
			#
			#  The reply is normally cached internally for
			#  a short period of time, after it is sent to
			#  the NAS.  The reply packet may be lost in
			#  the network, and the NAS will not see it.
			#  The NAS will then resend the request, and
			#  the server will respond quickly with the
			#  cached reply.
			#
			#  If this value is set too low, then
			#  duplicate requests from the NAS MAY NOT be
			#  detected, and will instead be handled as
			#  separate requests.
			#
			#  If this value is set too high, then the
			#  server will use more memory for no benefit.
			#
			#  This value can include a decimal number of
			#  seconds, e.g. "4.1".
			#
			#  Useful range of values: 2 to 30
			#
			cleanup_delay = 5.0
		}

		#
		#  #### UDP Transport
		#
		#  When the `listen` section contains `transport =
		#  udp`, it looks for a "udp" subsection.  This
		#  subsection contains all of the configuration for
		#  the UDP transport.
		#
		udp {
			#
			#  ipaddr:: The IP address where FreeRADIUS
			#  accepts packets.
			#
			#  The address can be IPv4, IPv6, a numbered
			#  IP address, or a host name.  If a host name
			#  is used, the IPv4 address is preferred.
			#  When there is no IPv4 address for a host
			#  name, the IPv6 address is used.
			#
			#  As with UDP, `ipaddr`, `ipv4addr`, and `ipv6addr`
			#  are all allowed.
			#
			#  ipv4addr:: Use IPv4 addresses.
			#
			#  The same as `ipaddr`, but will only use
			#  IPv4 addresses.
			#
			#  ipv6addr:: Use IPv6 addresses.
			#
			#  The same as `ipaddr`, but will only use

			#  for more information about how dynamic

			#
			#  networks:: The list of networks which are
			#  allowed to send packets to FreeRADIUS for
			#  dynamic clients.
			#
			#  If there are no dynamic clients, then this
			#  section is ignored.
			#
			#  The purpose of the `networks` subsection is

				#  deny:: deny some networks.
				#
				#  The default behavior is to only
				#  allow packets from the `allow`
				#  networks.  The `deny` directive
				#  allows you to carve out a subset of
				#  an `allow` network, where some
				#  packets are denied.
				#
				#  That is, a `deny` network MUST
				#  exist within a previous `allow` network.
				#
				#  The `allow` and `deny` rules apply

		#  Since UDP and TCP are similar, the majority of the
		#  configuration items are the same for both of them.

	#  The `eap` module takes care of all EAP authentication,
	#  including EAP-MD5, EAP-TLS, PEAP and EAP-TTLS.
	#
	#  The module also sets the EAP-Type attribute in the request
	#  list, to the incoming EAP type.
	#
	#  The `eap` module returns `ok` or `updated` if it is not yet ready to
	#  authenticate the user. The configuration below checks for
	#  that return value, and if so, stops processing the current
	#  section.
	#
	#  The result is that any LDAP and/or SQL servers will not be
	#  queried during the initial set of packets that go back and
	#  forth to set up EAP-TTLS or PEAP.
	#
	#  We also recommend doing user lookups in the `inner-tunnel`
	#  virtual server.

	#  packet contains a `User-Password` attribute.  The module
	#  does this only if the `Auth-Type` attribute has not already
	#  been set.
	#
	#  The `pap` module is also responsible for "normalizing" the
	#  various kinds of "known good" passwords.
	#  e.g. `Password.NT` may come as a 16 byte blob, or as a
	#  32-byte hex string, or as a base-64 encoded string.  The
	#  `pap` module will look for common variations of password
	#  encoding, and convert them all to a normal form.
	#
	#  This module should be listed last, so that the other
	#  modules get a chance to set Auth-Type for themselves.

######################################################################
#
#  == Authentication Sections
#
#  The sub-sections below are called based on the value of the
#  `Auth-Type` attribute, which should have been set by the `recv
#  Access-Request` section, above.
#
#  Since version 4, proxying also happens in this section.  For more
#  information on how proxying has changed in version 4, please see
#  https://www.freeradius.org/documentation/freeradius-server/4.0.0/howto/upgrade/proxy.html
#
#  For authentication, you should generally NOT set the `Auth-Type`
#  attribute.  As noted above, the modules will usually figure it what
#  to do, and will do the right thing.  The most common side effect of
#  erroneously setting the `Auth-Type` attribute is that one
#  authentication method will work, but all of the others will not.
#
#  The common reasons to set the `Auth-Type` attribute by hand are
#  to forcibly reject the user (`Auth-Type := ::Reject`), to or
#  forcibly accept the user (`Auth-Type := ::Accept`), or for
#  proxying.
#
#  Note that `Auth-Type := ::Accept` will NOT work with EAP.  The EAP
#  authentication protocol uses a series of handshake messages.  All
#  of the messages must be exchanged correctly in order for EAP
#  authentication to succeed.  Bypassing that process with `Auth-Type
#  := Accept` will just result in the user being rejected.
#
#  Policy configuration should generally go in the `send ...` sections
#  below, after authentication has completed.
#
######################################################################

#
#  === PAP Authentication
#
#  For users who are using PAP authentication. A back-end database
#  listed in the "recv Access-Request" section MUST supply a "known
#  good" password for the user.  The password can be clear-text, or
#  encrypted via `crypt`, `bcrypt`, or other hashing.
#
authenticate pap {
	pap
}

#
#  === CHAP Authentication
#
#  For users who are using CHAP authentication. A back-end database
#  listed in the "recv Access-Request" section MUST supply a
#  Password.Cleartext attribute. Encrypted passwords won't work.
#
authenticate chap {
	chap
}

#
#  === MS-CHAP authentication
#
#  For users who are using MS-CHAP authentication. A back-end
#  database listed in the "recv Access-Request" section MUST supply
#  either a Password.Cleartext attribute, or a Password.NT
#  attribute. Encrypted passwords won't work.
#
authenticate mschap {
	mschap
}

#
#  === SIP Digest Authentication
#
#  For users who are using SIP Digest authentication.
#
#  The `digest` line in the `recv Access-Request` section should also
#  be uncommented.
#
authenticate digest {
	digest
}

#
#  === PAM (Pluggable Authentication Modules) Authentication
#
#  Authenticate with PAM (Pluggable Authentication Modules).
#
#  We do not recommend using PAM.  The server has enough functionality
#  that anything that can be done in PAM can be done easier in
#  FreeRADIUS.
#
#authenticate pam {
#	pam
#}

#
#  === LDAP Authentication
#
#  For users who are using PAP, and when you can't get the "known
#  good" password from LDAP.  The module binds to the LDAP directory
#  as the user, along with the password taken from the User-Password
#  attribute.  The "bind as user" method means that CHAP, MS-CHAP, and
#  EAP won't work, as they do not supply a plain-text password.
#
#  We do NOT recommend using this. LDAP servers are databases, not
#  authentication servers.  It is only here as a last resort for
#  databases such as Active Directory.
#
#  We strongly recommend using `ldap` in the `recv Access-Request`
#  section.  And, ensuring that the account used by FreeRADIUS has
#  read permission on all of the users, groups, and passwords.
#
authenticate ldap {
	-ldap
}

#
#  === EAP Authentication
#
#  For EAP-MD5, EAP-MSCHAP, EAP-TLS, EAP-TTLS, EAP-PEAP, EAP-PWD, etc.
#
authenticate eap {
	eap
}


#
#  === Proxying
#
#  Proxying has changed substantially from v3 to v4.  These changes
#  are complex, but were necessary in order to support new features.
#  The result is that configurations which were impossible in v3 are
#  now trivial in v4.  For example:
#
#  * sending the same packet to multiple destinations, along with retransmissions
#  * sending the same packet to multiple destinations in parallel
#  * trying to proxy, and if it fails, programmatically doing something else
#  * trying to proxy, and if it fails, authenticating the user locally
#    * note that this won't work for EAP.
#
#  For more information, see:
#  https://www.freeradius.org/documentation/freeradius-server/4.0.0/howto/upgrade/proxy.html
#

#
#  The following example shows how proxying to three remote servers
#  can be configured.
#
#  Proxying will be done by setting `Auth-Type := example.com`, and
#  defining the home servers in `mods-available/radius`.
#
#  If you need to edit the request and/or the reply, you should use
#  the `subrequest` keyword.  See the `subrequest` documentation
#  for more information.
#

#authenticate example.com {
#	#
#	#  Log the request before proxying.
#	#
#	pre_proxy_log
#
#	#
#	#  Send the request to remote RADIUS servers, with
#	#  fail-over from one to the other if there's no response.
#	#
#	redundant {
#		radius1.example.com
#		radius2.example.com
#		radius3.example.com
#	}
#
#	#
#	#  Log the reply after proxying.

#
#  == Send replies to Access-Request packets
#

#
#  === send Access-Challenge packets
#
#
#  This section is called when sending an Access-Challenge
#  response. It is configured to filter out all attributes that should
#  not be in the packet.
#
send Access-Challenge {
	attr_filter.access_challenge
	handled
}

#
#  === send Access-Accept packets
#
#  Once we know that the user has been authenticated successfully,
#  there are additional things that can be done.
#
send Access-Accept {
	#
	#  If you need to have a State attribute, you can add it
	#  here. e.g. for later CoA-Request with State, and
	#  Service-Type = ::Authorize-Only.
	#
#	if (!reply.State) {
#		reply.State := "0x%str.rand(16h)"
#	}

	#
	#  For EAP-TTLS and PEAP, add any cached attributes to the
	#  reply. The "session-state" attributes are automatically
	#  cached when an Access-Challenge is sent, and retrieved
	#  when an `Access-Request` is received.
	#
	#  The `session-state` attributes are deleted after an
	#  `Access-Reject` or `Access-Accept` packet has been sent.

	#  The server is supposed to conclude that the start time was
	#  "Acct-Delay-Time" seconds in the past.
	#
	#  If there's no Event-Timestamp, then we create one, using
	#  Acct-Delay-Time as an offset if it exists.  BUT we only do

}

#
#  Version 4 allows for sections specific to Acct-Status-Type.
#
#  Once the `recv Accounting-Request` section is processed, one of the
#  `accounting ... { ... }` sections will be run, based on the
#  value of the `Acct-Status-Type` attribute.
#
#  After the `accounting ... { ... }` section has been run, it will
#  then process the `send Accounting-Response` section
#

#
#  == Sections for Acct-Status-Type

	#  Log traffic to an SQL database.
	#
	-sql

	#
	#  If you receive stop packets with zero session length,
	#  they will NOT be logged in the database. The SQL

#  * Tunnel-Link-Start
#  * Tunnel-Link-Stop
#  * Tunnel-Link-Reject
#
#  Some vendors also define their own values, which is a very bad idea.

#  === Send Accounting-Response.
#
#  Log the accounting data before replying. If logging fails then
#  the reply will not be sent, which means the NAS will send the
#  request again.
#
send Accounting-Response {

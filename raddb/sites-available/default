#	Read "man radiusd" before editing this file.  See the section
#	titled DEBUGGING.  It outlines a method where you can quickly
#	obtain the configuration you want, without running into
#	trouble.  See also "man unlang", which documents the format
#	of this file.
#
#	This configuration is designed to work in the widest possible
#	set of circumstances, with the widest possible number of
#	authentication methods.  This means that in general, you should
#	need to make very few changes to this file.
#
#	The best way to configure the server for your local system
#	is to CAREFULLY edit this file.  Most attempts to make large
#	edits to this file will BREAK THE SERVER.  Any edits should
#	be small, and tested by running the server with "radiusd -X".
#	Once the edits have been verified to work, save a copy of these
#	configuration files somewhere.  (e.g. as a "tar" file).  Then,
#	make more edits, and test, as above.
#
#	There are many "commented out" references to modules such
#	as ldap, sql, etc.  These references serve as place-holders.
#	If you need the functionality of that module, then configure
#	it in radiusd.conf, and un-comment the references to it in
#	this file.  In most cases, those small changes will result
#	in the server being able to connect to the DB, and to
#	authenticate users.

#
#  Authentication
#
#
#  The sections below are called based on the value of the
#  Auth-Type attribute, which should have been set by "recv
#  Access-Request", above.
#
#  Since version 4, proxying also happens in this section.
#
#  For authentication, you should generally NOT set the Auth-Type
#  attribute. The server will figure it out on its own, and will
#  do the right thing. The most common side effect of erroneously
#  setting the Auth-Type attribute is that one authentication
#  method will work, but the others will not.
#
#  The common reasons to set the Auth-Type attribute by hand are
#  to forcibly reject the user (Auth-Type := Reject), to or
#  forcibly accept the user (Auth-Type := Accept), or for
#  proxying.
#
#  Note that Auth-Type := Accept will NOT work with EAP.
#
#  unlang configuration should generally go in the "send" sections
#  below, after authentication has completed, not here.

	#  Session start times are *implied* in RADIUS. The NAS

	#  packet, *possibly* with an Acct-Delay-Time. The server
	#  is supposed to conclude that the start time was
	#  "Acct-Delay-Time" seconds in the past.
	#
	#  The unlang below creates an explicit start time, which
	#  can then be used in other modules. It will be *mostly*
	#  correct. Any errors are due to the 1-second resolution
	#  of RADIUS, and the possibility that the time on the NAS
	#  may be off.

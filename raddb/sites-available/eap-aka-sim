#
#  = EAP-SIM/EAP-AKA/EAP-AKA-Prime policy server
#
#  This server is an example of applying custom, site-specific policies
#  to eap-aka['] based authentication.
#  As much control is given to the user to make decisions about which
#  AT_* attributes will be returned to the supplicant. Wherever
#  possible the internal state of the EAP-AKA module will be updated
#  to reflect the attributes returned from sections.
#

######################################################################
#
#  ## Packet Processing sections
#
#  Sections in this server may behave slightly differently to sections
#  in other virtual servers, as they're being called directly by the
#  EAP-AKA module.
#
#  In general, the following rcodes signify a failure to the EAP-AKA
#  state machine:
#
#  - `reject`
#  - `fail`
#  - `invalid`
#  - `userlock`
#
#  Returning failure rcodes in the majority of sections will caused the
#  authentication to fail.
#
#  In some instances however, we ignore the section rcode, as the standard
#  does not allow for an orderly rejection of the supplicant.
#
#  Returning failure rcodes will be ignored in the following sections, and
#  will instead generate a warning:
#
#  - `send EAP-Failure`			already rejecting the auth attempt.
#  - `send Failure-Notification`	already rejecting the auth attempt.
#  - `recv Failure-Notification`	already rejecting the auth attempt.
#  - `recv Success-Notification`	sending failure after EAP-Response/
#					Success Notification-ACK would
#					violate the standard.
#  - `recv Authentication-Reject`	already rejecting the auth attempt.
#  - `recv Client-Error`		already rejecting the auth attempt.
#  - `clear pseudonym`			nothing more we can do...
#  - `clear session`			nothing more we can do...
#
#  For sections dealing with identity processing the `notfound` rcode
#  will trigger identity negotiation. The EAP-AKA module will then request
#  additional identity values from the supplicant.  See the `recv
#  EAP-Identity-Response` and `recv AKA-Identity-Response` sections for more
#  details.
#
#  NOTE: Setting the EAP-AKA subtype attribute is not supported, and any
#  attempts to modify it will be ignored (you are not trusted to know how to
#  run the EAP-AKA state machine better than the EAP-AKA module).

	#  ### `recv Identity-Response { ... }` - Process an EAP-Identity-Response or AKA-Identity value
	#
	#  This is usually the first section called when starting a new EAP-AKA
	#  session, and will be called for each round of identity negotiation.
	#
	#  The following request attributes are available:
	#  - `Identity`			the identity value received in the
	#  				EAP-Identity-Response.
	#  - `Permanent-Identity`	If the hint byte at the start of the
	#				identity string indicated it was
	#				permanent.
	#
	#  - `Identity-Type`		The type of identity the 'hint' byte
	#				at the start of the identity indicates.
	#				- `Permanent`
	#				- `Pseudonym`
	#				- `Fastauath`
	#
	#  - `Method-Hint`		The EAP-Method the 'hint' byte
	#				at the start of the identity indicates:
	#				- `AKA-Prime`
	#				- `AKA`
	#				- `SIM`
	#
	#  At the end of this section the value of `&Identity-Type` will be
	#  checked to see if any additional identity processing steps are
	#  required.
	#
	#  The following actions are associated with the various
	#  `Identity-Type` values:
	#  - `Permanent`::	The current `&Identity` value will be copied to
	#		  	`&session-state.Permanent-Identity`.  The hint byte
	#		   	will be stripped if the hint matches the current
	#			EAP-Method.  If the hint byte does not match
	#			the current EAP-Method the complete value of
	#			Identity will be copied.  In both cases the realm
	#			will also be stripped.  You can override the
	#			identity stored here in policy.
	#  - `Pseudonym`::	`load pseudonym { ... }` will be called.
	#  - `Fastauth`::	`load session { ... }` will be called.
	#
	#  #### Identity hints
	#
	#  In EAP-AKA['] and EAP-SIM, the first byte of the identity is used as
	#  a hint about what type of identity has been provided by the
	#  supplicant and which EAP method should be started.
	#
	#  `Identity-Type` and `Method-Hint` are added by the EAP-AKA module as
	#  a convenience to help determine if additional identities should be
	#  requested.
	#
	#  If for whatever reason the provided ID isn't not recognised or
	#  cannot be processed, you should return `notfound` from this section
	#  to request an additional identity from the supplicant.
	#
	#  Adding any of the following attributes to the reply list will also
	#  cause an additional identity to bre request from the supplicant.
	#
	#  - `Permanent-Id-Req`		request the supplicants `Permanent` Id
	#				usually its IMSI number.
	#  - `Fullauth-Id-Req`		request either a `Permanent` or a
	#				`Pseudonym` identity`.
	#  - `Any-Id-Req`		request any identity
	#				(`Fastauth`, `Pseudonym`, `Permanent``).
	#
	#  NOTE: We do not currently support handover between the EAP-AKA/SIM
	#  modules.  Usually this is not an issue because EAP Negotiation
	#  allows the supplicant and server to negotiate a mutually acceptable
	#  EAP type. If, however, you want to avoid the additional round trips
	#  involved in that negotiation, you can use
	#  `%(aka_sim_id_method:%{User-Name})` in the top level virtual server,
	#  which will return the EAP method hinted by the identity, and then
	#  set `&control.EAP-Type` to an appropriate value before calling the
	#  EAP module.
	#
	#  #### Pseudonyms
	#
	#  When receiving a `Identity-Type = Pseudonym` request, the pseudonym
	#  should either be decrypted or resolved to a permanent identity.
	#  Identity resolution can be done here, or in the `load pseudonym { ... }`
	#  section.
	#
	#  If for whatever reason the identity cannot be validated, you should
	#  return `notfound` to request an additional identity.
	#
	#  NOTE: Setting `&Method-Hint = Pseudonym` here will cause the server
	#  to execute the `load pseudonym { ... }` section next.  This is
	#  sometimes useful when dealing with non-standard pseudonym identities.
	#
	#  #### Reauthentication
	#
	#  When receiving a `Identity-Type = Fastauth` request, the fastauth
	#  identity should be resolved in a datastore of valid fastauth
	#  identities.
	#  Session resolution can be done here, or in the `load session { ... }`
	#  section.
	#
	#  If the identity cannot be resolved, you should return `notfound` to
	#  request an additional identity.
	#
	#  NOTE: Setting `&Method-Hint = Fastauth` here will cause the server
	#  to execute the `load session { ... }` section next.  This is
	#  sometimes useful when dealing with non-standard fastauth identities.
	#
	#  #### Custom identity schemes
	#
	#  Multiple identity privacy schemes have been proposed for
	#  EAP-SIM/AKA/AKA'.  Instead of hard coding implementations in the server
	#  source we've provided the necessary cryptographic functions for them to be
	#  implemented in policy.
	#
	#  The notable exception to this is the scheme described in
	#  3GPP TS 33.234 which is supported via the following expansions functions:
	#
	#  - 3gpp_temporary_id_key_index
	#  - 3gpp_temporary_id_decrypt
	#  - 3gpp_temporary_id_encrypt
	#
	#  The rlm_cipher module and the &control.KDF-Identity attribute override
	#  (see notes below) are provided to allow the "Privacy Protection for EAP-AKA"
	#  scheme described by 3GPP S3-170116 and the Wireless Broadband Allowance
	#  document "IMSI PRIVACY PROTECTION FOR WI-FI".
	#
	recv Identity-Response {
		ok
	}

	#
	#  ### `send Identity-Request { ... }` - Allow user massaging of Identity-Request
	#
	#  This section is called when a new Start or AKA-Identity request is
	#  sent to the supplicant, unless `send Start { ... }` or `send
	#  AKA-Identity { ... }` sections are provided, in which case they will
	#  be used instead.
	#
	send Identity-Request {
		ok
	}

	#
	#  ### `send Start-Request { ... }` - Allow specific policies to be applied to SIM start requests
	#
	#  This section is optional, and may be used to specify EAP-SIM only
	#  logic for sending Start requests.
	#
	#  If this section is not provided, `send Identity-Request { ... }`
	#  will be executed instead.
	#
	#  The Identity and Start messages perform a very similar role in
	#  EAP-SIM/EAP-AKA, the main difference being, Start messages also
	#  allow the version of EAP-SIM to be negotiated.
	#
#	send Start-Request {
#		ok
#	}

	#
	#  ### `send Start-Request { ... }` - Allow specific policies to be applied to SIM start responses
	#
	#  This section is optional, and may be used to specify EAP-SIM only
	#  logic for sending Start requests.
	#
	#  If this section is not provided, `send Identity-Request { ... }`
	#  will be executed instead.
	#
	#  The Identity and Start messages perform a very similar role in
	#  EAP-SIM/EAP-AKA, the main difference being, Start messages also
	#  allow the version of EAP-SIM to be negotiated.
	#
#	recv Start-Response {
#		ok
#	}

	#
	#  ### `send AKA-Identity-Request { ... }` - Allow specific policies to be applied to AKA identity requests
	#
	#  This section is optional, and may be used to specify
	#  EAP-AKA/EAP-AKA['] only logic for sending AKA-Identity requests.
	#
	#  If this section is not provided, `send Identity-Request { ... }`
	#  will be executed instead.
	#
	#  The Identity and Start messages perform a very similar role in
	#  EAP-SIM/EAP-AKA, the main difference being, Start messages also
	#  allow the version of EAP-SIM to be negotiated.
	#
#	send AKA-Identity-Request {
#		ok
#	}

	#
	#  ### `send Challenge-Request { ... }` - Acquire GSM triplets or UMTS quintuplets for the Challenge-Request
	#
	#  NOTE: It's recommended to perform identity resolution in `recv
	#  EAP-Identity-Response` or `recv Identity-Response` and request or
	#  generate UMTS quintuplets in this section.
	#
	#  The following attributes are added by the EAP-AKA module to the
	#  control list:
	#
	#  - `SIM-AMF = 0x8000`	Only set when using EAP-AKA'.
	#			This is a hint to any modules generating or
	#			retrieving UMTS quintuplets that the AMF
	#			separation bit should be high.
	#
	#  The following attributes are added by the EAP-AKA module to the reply
	#  list, to be modified by policy:
	#
	#  - `KDF-Input`	Only set when using EAP-AKA'
	#			Is initially set to the value of the
	#			`network_name` configuration item.  But can
	#			be set to anything.  If EAP is running over
	#			RADIUS this should usually be the SSID
	#			portion of Called-Station-ID.
	#  - `Bidding`		Only set when using EAP-AKA and the
	#			configuration item `prefer_aka_prime` is 'yes',
	#			or no `prefer_aka_prime` value is provided and
	#			EAP-AKA' is enabled in the same EAP module.
	#  - `Result-Ind`	Set when the configuration item
	#			`protected_success` is 'yes'.
	#
	#  Two sets of control attributes are used depending on how the
	#  quintuplets are being acquired.
	#
	#  If generating triplets or quintuplets locally you should provide the
	#  following control attributes:
	#
	#  - `SIM-Ki`::		Secret shared by the AuC and SIM card.
	#  - `SIM-SQN`::	Sequence number.  Must be stored/incremented
	#			for each set of quintuplets generated.  Used
	#			for replay protection, should be a higher
	#			value than the counterpart SQN on the SIM.
	#  - `SIM-OP`/`SIM-OPc`::Operator Variant Algorithm Configuration Field.
	#			Input to milenage.  Can provide SIM-OPc if you
	#			already have access to it, else the OPc will
	#			be derived from the OP. Must match the value
	#			configured on the SIM card.
	#
	#  If retrieving triplets from the AuC, you should should provide
	#  three sets of the following control attributes:
	#
	#  - `KC`::		Authentication value from the AuC.
	#  - `RAND`::		User authentication challenge.
	#  - `SRES`::		Signing response.
	#
	#  If retrieving quintuplets from an AuC, you should provide the
	#  following control attributes:
	#
	#  - `AUTN`::		Authentication value from the AuC.
	#  - `CK`::		Ciphering Key.
	#  - `IK`::		Integrity Key.
	#  - `RAND`::		User authentication challenge.
	#  - `XRES`::		Signing response.
	#  - `SQN`::		(optional)
	#  - `AK`::  		(optional)
	#
	#  ### Pseudonyms
	#
	#  For identity privacy you may include a `&reply.Next-Pseudonym`
	#  attribute. `&reply.Next-Pseudonym` must be a valid UTF8 string and
	#  MUST NOT contain a realm.  The supplicant will decorate the identity
	#  as appropriate to ensure correct routing.
	#
	#  The following facilitates may be useful when generating pseudonym
	#  values:
	#
	#  - The encrypt expansions of the `rlm_cipher` module.
	#  - The `%(3gpp_pseudonym_encrypt:)` expansion.
	#  - The `%randstr()` expansion.
	#
	#  NOTE: Add a `&reply.Next-Pseudonym-Id` attribute in this section to
	#  avoid having the permanent Id of the SIM exposed during subsequent
	#  authentication attempts.
	#  The value of this attribute may be empty (a zero length string) if
	#  which case a random value with the correct hint character will be
	#  generated for you.
	#
	#  ### Fast-Reauth
	#
	#  For identity privacy, to reduce load on the AuC, and to improve
	#  authentication times/user experience, fast re-authentication may be
	#  used.
	#
	#  Fast re-authentication is very similar to session-resumption in TLS
	#  based EAP methods, where the original MK (Master Key) is stored and
	#  then used to generate new MSKs (Master Session Keys) for subsequent
	#  authentication attempts.
	#
	#  NOTE: Add a `&reply.Next-Reauth-Id` attribute in this section, to
	#  allow session-resumption for subsequent authentication attempts.
	#  The value of this attribute may be empty (a zero length string) if
	#  which case a random value with the correct hint character will be
	#  generated for you.
	#
	#  ### Cryptographic identity overrides
	#
	#  The identity provided as the value of EAP-Response/Identity or in
	#  the last processed EAP-Response/AKA-Identity or
	#  EAP-Response/SIM-Start message is used as an input to generate the
	#  MK (Master Key) in full authentication, and XKEY' in
	#  re-authentication.
	#
	#  The identity used as inputs for these cryptographic values must be
	#  identical on both the supplicant and the EAP server, otherwise
	#  authentication will fail with the supplicant returning a
	#  EAP-Response/(AKA|SIM)-Client-Error message with an
	#  AT_CLIENT_ERROR_CODE of "unable to process packet".
	#
	#  Some handset manufacturers have implemented identity schemes which
	#  require an identity not provided in the EAP-Response/Identity
	#  message, or sent as an AT_IDENTITY value. One such identity privacy
	#  scheme described by 3GPP S3-170116 "Privacy Protection for EAP-AKA",
	#  where the cryptographic identity is the plaintext extracted from
	#  the encrypted identity blob.  The same behaviour is required for the
	#  evolution of that standard published by the WBA
	#  "IMSI PRIVACY PROTECTION FOR WI-FI".
	#
	#  Both standards as implemented in iOS and Android violate RFC 4186,
	#  RFC 4187,and RFC 5448 in requiring that the Identity input to the
	#  cryptographic function used to derive the MK for the session be set
	#  to the decrypted identity, not the last value of AT_IDENTITY as
	#  stated by the original RFCs.
	#
	#  No where is this mentioned in either the original 3GPP proposal or the
	#  WBA document.
	#
	#  If you need to implement one of these identity privacy schemes, the
	#  cryptographic identity can be specified with `&control.KDF-Identity`.
	#
	send Challenge-Request {
		ok
	}

	#
	#  ### `recv Challenge-Response { ... }` - Allow additional authorization checks and logging
	#
	#  The following rcodes have special meanings in this section:
	#
 	#  - `reject`			Reject the authentication attempt, send
 	#				a Failure-Notification with an
 	#				AT_NOTIFICATION value of 1026
 	#				(User has been temporarily denied access).
 	#  - `userlock`			Reject the authentication attempt, send
 	#				a Failure-Notification with an
 	#				AT_NOTIFICATION value of 1026
 	#				(User has been temporarily denied access).
 	#  - `notfound`			Reject the authentication attempt, send
 	#				a Failure-Notification with an
 	#				AT_NOTIFICATION value of 1031
 	#				(User has not subscribed to the requested service).
 	#  - `invalid`			Reject the authentication attempt, send
 	#				a Failure-Notification with an
 	#				AT_NOTIFICATION value of 0
 	#				(General failure after authentication).
 	#  - `Fail`			Reject the authentication attempt, send
 	#				a Failure-Notification with an
 	#				AT_NOTIFICATION value of 0
 	#				(General failure after authentication).
 	#  - Anything else		Continue processing the request.
	#
	recv Challenge-Response {
		ok
	}

	#
	#  ### `recv Reauthentication-Request { ... }` - Allow user massaging of a reauthentication request
	#
	#  There's not much to do here as the majority of the work for
	#  session resumption is done in `load session { ... }`.
	#
	#  Add a `&reply.Next-Pseudonym` attribute in this section if you want
	#  to allow avoid having the permanent Id of the SIM exposed during
	#  subsequent authentication attempts.
	#
	#  Add a `&reply.Next-Reauth-Id` attribute in this section, to allow
	#  session resumption for subsequent authentication attempts.
	#
	#  The following rcodes have special meanings in this section:
	#
 	#  - `reject`			Reject the authentication attempt, send
 	#				a Failure-Notification with an
 	#				AT_NOTIFICATION value of 16384

	#  not clear that this is allowed by RFC4186/RFC4187.
	#
	recv Reauthentication-Response {

	}

	#
	#  ### `recv Client-Error { ... }` - Log the fact that the supplicant has terminated authentication
	#
	#  The reason for the error should be available in `&Client-Error-Code`
	#
	#  After this section is run authentication fails immediately with no
	#  EAP-Response/AKA-Notification round.
	#
	recv Client-Error {

	#
	#  ### `recv Authentication-Reject { ... }` - Log the fact that the supplicant failed to authenticate the AuC
	#
	#  NOTE: Only used for EAP-AKA and EAP-AKA'
	#
	#  The supplicant will respond with EAP-Response/AKA-Authentication-Reject
	#  whenever it cannot validate the AUTN (authentication) value provided in the
	#  EAP-Request/AKA-Challenge packet.
	#
	#  No additional attributes are provided by the supplicant that specify

	#
	#  NOTE: Only used for EAP-AKA and EAP-AKA'
	#
	#  In some instances the SQN on the SIM card and the SQN in the AuC can
	#  get out of sync.  When this happens the supplicant will send a
	#  EAP-Response/Synchronization-Failure message with an AUTS attribute.
	#
	#  If the original UMTS quintuplets were calculated locally and you
	#  provided Ki and OP/OPc in the Challenge-Request round, then the
	#  EAP-AKA module will automatically calculate a new SQN for you and
	#  place it in `&control.SIM-SQN`.  You should store this new SQN.
	#
	#  As a convenience, the EAP-AKA module will also repopulate
	#  &control.SIM-Ki and &control.SIM-OPc so you do not need to retrieve
	#  them again in the `send Challenge-Request { ... }` section.
	#
	#  If the UMTS quintuplets were provided by an AuC, you should submit
	#  the AUTS value to the AuC to allow it to calculate a new SQN, then
	#  retrieve a new UMTS quintuplet in the
	#  `send Challenge-Request { ... }` section.
	#
	#  If the rcode returned from this section does not indicate failure
	#  and a &control.SQN value is provided, we send a new challenge to
	#  the supplicant and continue; otherwise authentication fails.
	#
	#  NOTE: Only one Synchronisation attempt is permitted per
	#  authentication attempt.
	#
	recv Synchronization-Failure {

	#  ### `send Failure-Notification { ... }` - Allow massaging/logging of failure notifications
	#
	#  NOTE: The rcode returned from this section is ignored.

	recv Failure-Notification-ACK {
		ok
	}

	#
	#  ### `send Success-Notification { ... }` - Allow massaging/logging of success notifications
	#
	#  Uses the same rcode mappings as `recv Challenge-Response { ... }`.
	#
	#  NOTE: Only entered if protected result indications are used.
	#
	send Success-Notification {
		ok
	}

	#
	#  ### `send Success-Notification-Ack { ... }` - Allow logging of success notification acknowledgements
	#
	#  NOTE: The rcode returned from this section is ignored.
	#
	recv Success-Notification-ACK {
		ok
	}

	#
	#  ### `send EAP-Success { ... }` - Allow massaging/logging of success notifications
	#
	#  NOTE: The rcode returned from this section is ignored if we have already sent
	#  a Success-Notification, otherwise the same rcode mappings as
	#  `recv Challenge-Response { ... }` are used.
	#
	send EAP-Success {
		ok

	#  ### `send EAP-Failure { ... }` - Allow logging of failure notification acknowledgements
	#
	#  NOTE: The rcode returned from this section is ignored.

	#
	#  ### `store pseudonym { ... }`
	#
	#  If when sending a Challenge-Request Reauthentication-Request a
	#  `&reply.Next-Pseudonym-Id` attribute is found, this section will be
	#  called.
	#
	#  If `&reply.Next-Pseudonym-Id` is empty, it will be filled with a random
	#  string of alphanumeric characters.
	#
	#  For consistency, &reply.Next-Pseudonym-Id will also be made available
	#  temporarily in `&Next-Pseudonym-Id` for use as a key.
	#
	#  You should store the following attributes against the key
 	#  `&Next-Paeudonym-Id`:
 	#
 	#  - `&session-state.Permanent-Identity`::The permanent identity of the user.
	#
	#  If a failure rcode is returned authentication continues but the
	#  Next-Pseudonym-Id will not be sent to the supplicant.
	#
	#  NOTE: The cache module is ideally suited for storing pseudonym
	#  data.  If you're using multiple instances of FreeRADIUS in a
	#  failover cluster, you may wish to use the redis or memcached drivers
	#  to provide a unified pseudonym store.
	#
	#  NOTE: If you're using 3GPP style encrypted pseudonyms you do not
	#  need populate this section.  You should however, provide a policy
	#  for `load session { ... }`, and use that to decrypt the pseudonym.
	#
	store pseudonym {
		ok
	}

	#
	#  ### `load pseudonym { ... }`
	#
	#  This section will be called prior to entering the AKA-CHALLENGE state.
	#
	#  You should restore the contents of the following attributes using
	#  `&Next-Pseudonym-Id` as a key:
	#
 	#  - `&session-state.Permanent-Identity`::The permanent identity of the user.
 	#
 	#  NOTE: If you're using 3GPP style encrypted pseudonyms, you should
 	#  decrypt the pseudonym here, and store the decrypted value in
 	#  `&session-state.Permanent-Identity`.
 	#
	load pseudonym {
		ok
	}

	#
	#  ### `clear pseudonym { ... }`
	#
	#  This section we be called if authentication or re-authentication fails.
	#
	#  You should remove any session information stored against
	#  `&Next-Pseudonym-Id`.
	#
	clear pseudonym {
		ok
	}

	#
	#  ### `store session { ... }`
	#
	#  If when sending a Reauthentication-Request a `&reply.Next-Reauth-Id`
	#  attribute is found, this section will be called.
	#
	#  You should restore the contents of the following attributes using
	#  `&request.Session-ID` as a key:
	#
 	#  - `&session-state.Counter`::		How many times this session has
 	#					been resumed.
 	#  - `&session-state.Session-Data`::	The master session key.
 	#  - `&session-state.Permanent-Identity`::(optionally) the permanent
 	#					identity of the user.
	#
	#  If a failure rcode is returned, authentication continues but the
	#  Next-Reauth-Id will not be sent to the supplicant.
	#
	#  NOTE: The cache module is ideally suited for storing session data.
	#  If you're using multiple instances of FreeRADIUS in a failover
	#  cluster, you may wish to use the redis or memcached drivers to
	#  provide a unified session store.
	#
	store session {
		ok
	}

	#
	#  ### `load session { ... }`
	#
	#  This section will be called prior to attempting re-authentication.
	#
	#  You should restore the contents of the following attributes using
	#  `&request.Session-ID` as a key:
	#
 	#  - `&session-state.Counter`::		How many times this session has
 	#					been resumed.
 	#  - `&session-state.Session-Data`::	The master session key.
 	#  - `&session-state.Permanent-Identity`::(optionally) the permanent
 	#					identity of the user.
 	#
 	#  The following rcodes have special meanings in this section:
 	#
 	#  - `reject`			Reject the authentication attempt, send
 	#				a Failure-Notification with an
 	#				AT_NOTIFICATION value of 16384
 	#				(General Failure).
 	#  - `userlock`			Reject the authentication attempt, send
 	#				a Failure-Notification with an
 	#				AT_NOTIFICATION value of 16384
 	#				(General Failure).
 	#  - `ok`			Continue with reauthentication.
 	#  - `updated`			Continue with reauthentication.
 	#  - Anything else		Fall back to full authentication.
 	#
	load session {

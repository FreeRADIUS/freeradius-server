#  Write a 'utmp' style file, of which users are currently
#  logged in, and where they've logged in from.
#
#  This file is used mainly for Simultaneous-Use checking,
#  and also 'radwho', to see who's currently logged in.

	#  'user' name,  If you have other fields which you want
	#  to use to key on to control Simultaneous-Use,
	#  then you can use them here.
	#
	#  Note, however, that the size of the field in the
	#  'utmp' data structure is small, around 32
	#  characters, so that will limit the possible choices
	#  of keys.
	#
	#  You may want instead: %{Stripped-User-Name:-%{User-Name}}

	#  Whether or not we want to treat "user" the same
	#  as "USER", or "User".  Some systems have problems
	#  with case sensitivity, so this should be set to
	#  'no' to enable the comparisons of the key attribute
	#  to be case insensitive.

	#  Accounting information may be lost, so the user MAY
	#  have logged off of the NAS, but we haven't noticed.
	#  If so, we can verify this information with the NAS,
	#
	#  If we want to believe the 'utmp' file, then this
	#  configuration entry can be set to 'no'.

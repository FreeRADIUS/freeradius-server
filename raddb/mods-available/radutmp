#  = Radutmp Module
#
#  The `radutmp` module writes a `utmp` style file, of which users are
#  currently logged in, and where they've logged in from.
#
#  This file is used mainly for `Simultaneous-Use` checking,
#  and also `radwho`, to see who's currently logged in.
#
#  See also `man 5 utmp`.
#

#
#  ## Configuration Settings
#
radutmp {
	#
	#  filename:: Where the file is stored.
	#
	#  It's not a log file, so it doesn't need rotating.
	#
	filename = ${logdir}/radutmp

	#
	#  username:: The field in the packet to key on for the users name.
	#
	#  If you have other fields which you want to use to key on to control
	#  `Simultaneous-Use`, then you can use them here.
	#
	#  However, that the size of the field in the `utmp` data
	#  structure is small, around `32` characters, so that will limit
	#  the possible choices of keys.
	#
	#  TIP: You may want instead: `%{%{Stripped-User-Name}:-%{User-Name}}`.
	#
	username = %{User-Name}

	#
	#  check_with_nas:: Accounting information may be lost, so the user MAY
	#  have logged off of the NAS, but we haven't noticed.
	#
	#  If so, we can verify this information with the NAS.
	#
	#  If we want to believe the 'utmp' file, then this configuration entry
	#  can be set to `no`.
	#
	check_with_nas = yes

	#
	#  permissions:: Set the file permissions, as the contents of this file
	#  are usually private.
	#
	permissions = 0600

	#
	#  caller_id:: If enabled, it will extract the field `Calling-Station-Id` from
	#  the packet and store as `username` information.
	#
	#  Default is `no`.
	#
#	caller_id = "yes"
}

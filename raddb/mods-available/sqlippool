#  = SQL-IP-Pool Module
#
#  The module `sqlippool` provide configuration for the SQL based IP Pool module.
#
#  NOTE: The database schemas are available at `raddb/sql/ippool/<DB>/schema.sql`.
#
#  ## Configuration Settings
#
sqlippool {
	#
	#  sql_module_instance:: SQL instance to use (from `raddb/mods-available/sql`)
	#
	#  If you have multiple sql instances, such as `sql sql1 {...}`,
	#  use the *instance* name here: `sql1`.
	#
	sql_module_instance = "sql"

	#
	#  dialect:: This is duplicative of info available in the SQL module, but
	#  we have to list it here as we do not yet support nested
	#  reference expansions.
	#
	dialect = "mysql"

	#
	#  ippool_table:: SQL table to use for ippool range and lease info.
	#
	ippool_table = "fr_ippool"

	#
	#  lease_duration:: IP lease duration.
	#
	lease_duration = 3600

	#
	#  allocated_address_attr:: List and attribute where the allocated address is written to.
	#
	#  [NOTE]
	#  ====
	#  It MUST be a qualified name of an attribute of a type which contains IP addresses.
	#
	#  e.g. `ipaddr`, `ipv4prefix,` `ipv6addr`, or `ipv6prefix`.
	#  ====
	allocated_address_attr = radius.Framed-IP-Address

	#
	#  owner:: Expansion which identifies the owner of the lease.
	#
	#  For an operation (i.e. a request to extend a lease, or release an
	#  IP address) to be applied, the owner specified in the incoming
	#  packet must match the owner recorded for the lease.
	#
	#  For purposes such as IP assignment using a RADIUS Framed-IP-Address
	#  attribute the "owner" identifier could be a `User-Name` or a
	#  certificate serial number provided that the number of sessions is
	#  limited to one per user/serial.
	#
	#  For RADIUS the owner will likely be specified by:
	#
	#  * `%{radius.Calling-Station-Id}` which binds the lease to the mac address
	#    of the user's device.  For RADIUS this is almost always the better
	#    option as it can allow the user's device to move between NAS.
	#
	#  * `%{radius.NAS-Port}` which binds the lease to a given port on the NAS.
	#    i.e. any device on that port can modify the lease.  This should only
	#    be used when the port is constant for the length of the session
	#    (nearly everywhere except 802.11 wireless).
	#
	#  For DHCPv4 the owner will likely be specified by:
	#
	#  * `%{dhcpv4.Client-Hardware-Address}` which binds the lease to the
	#    mac address of the user's device.
	#
	#  * `%{%{dhcpv4.Client-Identifier}:-%{dhcpv4.Client-Hardware-Address}}`
	#    which binds the lease to either the custom identifier set by the
	#    DHCP client, or if this is absent, the mac address of the user's
	#    device.
	#
	#  On a hostile network the owner SHOULD include a component that you
	#  trust, arranged such that the overall value cannot be spoofed by
	#  manipulation of the user-controlled data (i.e. the mac or identifier)
	#  provided by the user's device.
	#
	#  For example it might be that the value `Vendor-Specific.ADSL-Forum.Agent-Circuit-ID` is
	#  considered trusted as it's set by a controlled device at the edge of
	#  the network.  Calling-Station-Id however, is usually provided by
	#  the user's device so may be spoofed.
	#
	#  In order to prevent an attacker releasing DHCP leases for another
	#  device on the network, the owner string should be constructed so
	#  that it contains both the trusted and untrusted attributes, or if
	#  the trusted attribute is sufficiently stable and unique, only the
	#  trusted attribute.
	#  One example would be `%{Vendor-Specific.ADSL-Forum.Agent-Circuit-ID}.%{Calling-Station-Id}`.`
	#
	owner = "%{radius.Calling-Station-ID}"

#       owner = "%{radius.Vendor-Specific.ADSL-Forum.Agent-Circuit-ID}.%{radius.Calling-Station-Id}"

#	owner = "%{%{dhcpv4.Client-Identifier}:-%{dhcpv4.Client-Hardware-Address}}"

	#
	#  requested_address:: The IP address being renewed or released.
	#
	#  For RADIUS the requested_address will almost always be `%{radius.Framed-IP-Address}`.
	#
	#  For DHCPv4 the requested_address will almost always be
	#  `%{%{dhcpv4.Requested-IP-Address}:-%{dhcpv4.Client-IP-Address}}`.
	#
	requested_address = "%{radius.Framed-IP-Address}"

#	requested_address = "%{%{dhcpv4.Requested-IP-Address}:-%{dhcpv4.Client-IP-Address}}"

	#
	#  gateway:: The device controlling access to the network or relaying
	#  DHCP packets.
	#
	#  For RADIUS, this device is recorded so that if an Accounting-On or
	#  Accounting-Off packet is received, then all leases associated with
	#  the gateway can be released. 'gateway' in this context is synonymous
	#  with the NAS the user is connected to.
	#
	#  For DHCPv4, this device is recorded so that we can respond correctly
	#  to lease queries.
	#
	gateway = "%{%{radius.NAS-Identifier}:-%{radius.NAS-IP-Address}}"

#       gateway = "%{dhcpv4.Gateway-IP-Address}"

	#
	#  messages { ... }:: These messages are added to the `control.:` items, as
	#  `Module-Success-Message`. They are not logged anywhere else, unlike
	#  previous versions.
	#  If you want to have them logged to a file, see the `linelog` module,
	#  and create an entry which writes `Module-Success-Message` message.
	#
	#  WARNING: MySQL (MyISAM) has certain limitations that means it can hand out
	#  the same IP address to 2 different users.
	#  *We suggest* using an SQL DB with proper transaction support, such as PostgreSQL,
	#  or using MySQL with InnoDB.

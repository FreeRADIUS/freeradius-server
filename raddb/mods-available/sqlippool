#  Configuration for the SQL based IP Pool module (rlm_sqlippool)
#
#  The database schemas are available at:
#
#       raddb/mods-config/sql/ippool/<DB>/schema.sql
#
#  $Id$

sqlippool {
	# SQL instance to use (from mods-available/sql)
	#
	#  If you have multiple sql instances, such as "sql sql1 {...}",
	#  use the *instance* name here: sql1.
	sql_module_instance = "sql"

	#  This is duplicative of info available in the SQL module, but
	#  we have to list it here as we do not yet support nested
	#  reference expansions.
	dialect = "mysql"

	# Name of the check item attribute to be used as a key in the SQL queries
	pool_name = "Pool-Name"

	# SQL table to use for ippool range and lease info
	ippool_table = "radippool"

	# IP lease duration. (Leases expire even if Acct Stop packet is lost)
	#
	#  Note that you SHOULD also set Session-Timeout to this value!
	#  That way the NAS will automatically kick the user offline when the
	#  lease expires.
	#
	lease_duration = 3600

	#
	# Timeout between each consecutive 'allocate_clear' queries (default: 1s)
	# This will avoid having too many deadlock issues, especially on MySQL backend.
	#
	allocate_clear_timeout = 1

	#
	#  As of 3.0.16, the 'ipv6 = yes' configuration is deprecated.
	#  You should use the "attribute_name" configuration item
	#  below, instead.
	#

	#
	#  The attribute to use for IP address assignment.  The
	#  default is Framed-IP-Address.  You can change this to any
	#  attribute which is IPv4 or IPv6.
	#
	#  e.g. Framed-IPv6-Prefix, or Delegated-IPv6-Prefix.
	#
	#  As of 3.0.16, all of the default queries have been updated to use
	#  this attribute_name.  So you can do IPv6 address assignment simply
	#  by putting IPv6 addresses into the pool, and changing the following
	#  line to "Framed-IPv6-Prefix"
	#
	#  Note that you MUST use separate pools for each attribute.  i.e. one pool
	#  for Framed-IP-Address, a different one for Framed-IPv6-prefix, etc.
	#
	#  This means configuring separate "sqlippool" instances, and different
	#  "ippool_table" in SQL.  Then, populate the pool with addresses and
	#  it will all just work.
	#
	attribute_name = Framed-IP-Address

	#
	#  Assign the IP address, even if the above attribute already exists
	#  in the reply.
	#
#	allow_duplicates = no

	#  The attribute in which an IP address hint may be supplied
	req_attribute_name = Framed-IP-Address

	# Attribute which should be considered unique per NAS
	#
	#  Using NAS-Port gives behaviour similar to rlm_ippool. (And ACS)
	#  Using Calling-Station-Id works for NAS that send fixed NAS-Port
	#  ONLY change this if you know what you are doing!
	pool_key = "%{NAS-Port}"
	# pool_key = "%{Calling-Station-Id}"

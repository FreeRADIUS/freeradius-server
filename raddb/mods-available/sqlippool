#  = SQL-IP-Pool Module
#
#  The module `sqlippool` provide configuration for the SQL based IP Pool module.
#
#  NOTE: The database schemas are available at `raddb/sql/ippool/<DB>/schema.sql`.
#
#  ## Configuration Settings
#
sqlippool {
	#
	#  sql_module_instance:: SQL instance to use (from `raddb/mods-available/sql`)
	#
	#  If you have multiple sql instances, such as `sql sql1 {...}`,
	#  use the *instance* name here: `sql1`.
	#
	sql_module_instance = "sql"

	#
	#  dialect:: This is duplicative of info available in the SQL module, but
	#  we have to list it here as we do not yet support nested
	#  reference expansions.
	#
	dialect = "mysql"

	#
	#  ippool_table:: SQL table to use for ippool range and lease info.
	#
	ippool_table = "radippool"

	#
	#  lease_duration:: IP lease duration. (Leases expire even if `Acct Stop` packet is lost).
	#
	lease_duration = 3600

	#
	#  attribute_name:: Attribute to use for querying / updating IP addresses.
	#
	#  [NOTE]
	#  ====
	#  It MUST be a type which contains IP addresses.
	#
	#  e.g. `ipaddr`, `ipv4prefix,` `ipv6addr`, or `ipv6prefix`.
	#  ====
	#
	attribute_name = Framed-IP-Address

	#
	#  pool_key:: Attribute which should be considered unique per NAS.
	#
	#  * Using `NAS-Port` gives behaviour similar to `rlm_ippool` and ACS. (default).
	#  * Using `Calling-Station-Id` works for NAS that send fixed `NAS-Port`.
	#
	#  WARNING: ONLY change this if you know what you are doing!
	#
	pool_key = "%{NAS-Port}"

	#
	#  messages { ... }:: These messages are added to the `control::` items, as
	#  `Module-Success-Message`. They are not logged anywhere else, unlike
	#  previous versions.
	#  If you want to have them logged to a file, see the `linelog` module,
	#  and create an entry which writes `Module-Success-Message` message.
	#
	#  WARNING: MySQL (MyISAM) has certain limitations that means it can hand out
	#  the same IP address to 2 different users.
	#  *We suggest* using an SQL DB with proper transaction support, such as PostgreSQL,
	#  or using MySQL with InnoDB.
	#

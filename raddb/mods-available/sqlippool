#  Configuration for the SQL based IP Pool module (rlm_sqlippool)

	#
	#  If you have multiple sql instances, such as "sql sql1 {...}",
	#  use the *instance* name here: sql1.
	sql_module_instance = "sql"

	#  This is duplicative of info available in the SQL module, but
	#  we have to list it here as we do not yet support nested
	#  reference expansions.

	# SQL table to use for ippool range and lease info
	ippool_table = "radippool"

	# IP lease duration. (Leases expire even if Acct Stop packet is lost)
	lease_duration = 3600

	# protocol to use.  The default is IPv4.
#	ipv6 = yes

	# Attribute which should be considered unique per NAS
	#
	#  Using NAS-Port gives behaviour similar to rlm_ippool. (And ACS)
	#  Using Calling-Station-Id works for NAS that send fixed NAS-Port
	#  ONLY change this if you know what you are doing!

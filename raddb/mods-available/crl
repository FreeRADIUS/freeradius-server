#  = CRL Module
#
#  The `crl` module provides CRL checking of TLS certificates.
#
#  Its primary use case is within the `verify certificate` processing
#  section of the `tls-session` virtual server when verifying client
#  certificates during EAP-TLS.
#

#
#  ## Configuration Settings
#
crl {
	#
	#  crl:: Expansion used to retrieve a CRL.
	#
	#  The CRL distribution point URI will be in the
	#  attribute `CRL.CDP-URL` when this expansion is performed.
	#
	crl = %rest('GET', "%uri.safe(%{CRL.CDP-URL})")

	#
	#  force_expiry:: Maximum time between expiring CRLs
	#
	#  If the `nextUpdate` attribute of a CRL is closer than this interval
	#  then that will be used as the point that the CRL is expired.
	#
#	force_expiry = 7d
}

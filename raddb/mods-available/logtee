#  = Logtee Module
#
#  The `logtee` module writes the log messages to a socket or to a
#  file.  Each instance of the module can send log messages to one,
#  and only one, destination.
#
#  NOTE: Multiple `logtee`s modules may be used for any given request.
#  The `logtee` modules will not affect normal logging output.
#  i.e. This logging is *in addition* to any other logging that is
#  done by the server.
#

#
#  ## Configuration Settings
#
logtee {
	#
	#  delimiter::  Custom line delimiters.
	#
	#  Defaults to `\n` (newline) but may be any UTF8 multi-character
	#  string.
	#
#	delimiter = "\n"

	#
	#  format:: The default format string.
	#
	#  Additional expansions are available:
	#
	#  [options="header,autowidth"]
	#  |===
	#  | Option           | Description
	#  | `%{Log-Message}` | The log message
	#  | `%{Log-Level}`	  | Debugging level
	#  | `%{Log-Type}`	  | Error, Warn, Info, Debug etc...
	#  |===
	#
	#  NOTE: Format could contain markup (JSON for example), but it's up
	#  to the user to call the appropriate escaping function.
	#
	format = "%{Log-Type} - %{Log-Level} - %{Log-Message}"

	#
	#  buffer_depth::
	#
	#  The number of log messages we buffer before discarding.
	#
	#  The module writes log messages to a ring buffer between
	#  processing requests and checking whether the output socket is
	#  writable, so this should be not set to < `1000`.
	#
	#  If an error occurs (connection failed, out of disk space
	#  etc...) the ring buffer will be used to temporarily buffer
	#  log data until the error is cleared.
	#
	#  This limit is applied per worker thread.
	#
#	buffer_depth = 1000000

	#
	#  destination:: What should be done with log messages.
	#
	#  May be one of:
	#
	#  [options="header,autowidth"]
	#  |===
	#  | Option | Description
	#  | file   | Write to a file - NYI.
	#  | tcp    | Write to a TCP socket.
	#  | udp    | Write to a UDP socket.
	#  | unix   | Write to a UNIX socket.
	#  |===
	#
	#  NOTE: Syslog ouput via `syslog()` is not explicitly supported,
	#  but you may use one of the other transports to talk directly to
	#  a syslog daemon.
	#
	destination = 'file'

	#
	#  connection_timeout:: How long we wait for a connection or file to open.
	#
	#  If a connection takes longer than this to open, the module returns `fail`.
	#
	connection_timeout = 1.0

	#
	#  reconnection_delay::
	#
	#  How long to wait after a connection or file has become
	#  unusable, to try and re-open the connection or file.
	#
	reconnection_delay = 1.0

	#
	#  .File as the destination for log output
	#
	file {
		#
		#  filename:: The file where the logs will go.
		#
		filename = ${logdir}/linelog

		#
		#  permissions:: The Unix-style permissions on the log file.
		#
		#  Depending on format string, the log file may contain secret or
		#  private information about users.  Keep the file permissions as
		#  restrictive as possible.
		#
		permissions = 0600

		#
		#  group:: The Unix group which owns the log file.
		#
		#  The user that freeradius runs as must be in the specified
		#  group, otherwise it will not be possible to set the group.
		#
#		group = ${security.group}

		#
		#  escape_filenames::
		#
		#  Most file systems can handly nearly the full range of UTF-8
		#  characters.  Ones that can deal with a limited range should
		#  set this to `yes`.
		#
		escape_filenames = no
	}

	#
	#  .UNIX socket-file as the destination for log outputx
	#
	unix {
		#
		#  filename:: Fullpath to the `unix socket` file.
		#
		filename = /path/to/unix.socket
	}

	#
	#  .TCP-server as the destination for log output
	#
	tcp {
		#
		#  server:: Server to connect to.
		#
		server = "example.org"

		#
		#  port:: Port to connect to.
		#
		port = 514
	}

	#
	#  .UDP-server as the destination for log output
	#
	udp {
		#
		#  server:: Server to connect to.
		#
		server = "example.org"

		#
		#  port:: Port to connect to.
		#
		port = 514
	}

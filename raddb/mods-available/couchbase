#  The `couchbase` module is used to provides connections to a `Couchbase` database.

	#  Configuration items are in the format `<radius attribute> = '<element name>'`

		#
		#  If these connections are all in use and a new one
		#  is requested, the request will NOT get a connection.
		#
		#  Setting `max` to LESS than the number of threads means
		#  that some threads may starve, and you will see errors
		#  like '_No connections available and at max connection limit_'
		#
		#  Setting `max` to MORE than the number of threads means
		#  that there are more connections than necessary.
		#
		max = ${thread[pool].num_workers}

		#
		#  spare:: Spare connections to be left idle.
		#
		#  NOTE: Idle connections *WILL* be closed if `idle_timeout`
		#  is set.  This should be less than or equal to `max` above.
		#
		spare = 1

		#
		#  uses:: Number of uses before the connection is closed.
		#
		#  NOTE: `0` means "infinite".
		#
		uses = 0

		#
		#  lifetime:: The lifetime (in seconds) of the connection.
		#
		#  NOTE: A setting of `0` means infinite (no limit).
		#
		lifetime = 0

		#
		#  idle_timeout:: The idle timeout (in seconds).  A connection which is
		#  unused for this length of time will be closed.
		#
		#  NOTE: A setting of `0` means infinite (no timeout).

		#  [WARNING]
		#  ====
		#  All configuration settings are enforced.  If a
		#  connection is closed because of `idle_timeout`,
		#  `uses`, or `lifetime`, then the total number of
		#  connections *MAY* fall below `min`.  When that
		#  happens, it will open a new connection.  It will
		#  also log a *WARNING* message.
		#
		#  The solution is to either lower the `min` connections,
		#  or increase `lifetime`/`idle_timeout`.

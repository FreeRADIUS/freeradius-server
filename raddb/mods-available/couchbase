		#  [WARNING]
		#  ====
		#  All configuration settings are enforced.  If a
		#  connection is closed because of `idle_timeout`,
		#  `uses`, or `lifetime`, then the total number of
		#  connections *MAY* fall below `min`.  When that
		#  happens, it will open a new connection.  It will
		#  also log a *WARNING* message.
		#
		#  The solution is to either lower the `min` connections,
		#  or increase `lifetime`/`idle_timeout`.

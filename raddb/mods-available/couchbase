#  = Couchbase Module
#
#  The `couchbase` module is used to provide connections to a `Couchbase` database.
#
#  It is possible to fetch the content using N1QL as the below example.
#
#  e.g:
#
#  ```
#  map couchbase "SELECT myfield1,myfield2 FROM `mybucket` WHERE id='123'" {
#    &control:Tmp-String-0 := 'myfield1'
#    &control:Tmp-String-1 := 'myfield2'
#  }
#  ```
#  And use the content stored in `&control:Tmp-String-0`.
#

#
#  ## Configuration Settings
#
couchbase {
	#
	#  server:: List of Couchbase hosts (hosts may be space, tab, comma or semicolon separated).
	#  Ports are optional if servers are listening on the standard port.
	#
	#  NOTE: Complete pool urls are preferred.
	#
	server = "http://cb01.example.org:8091/ http://cb02.example.org:8091/"

	#
	#  bucket:: Couchbase bucket name.
	#

	#
	#  username:: Couchbase bucket username (optional).
	#
#	username = "radius"

	#
	#  password:: Couchbase bucket password (optional).
	#
#	password = "password"

	#
	#  opts { ... }:: flags for libcouchbase (see Couchbase documentation).
	#
	#  Set this to enable debugging, view timeouts, and all options
	#  supported by `lcb_cntl_string()` from libcouchbase API.
	#
	#  NOTE: These debugging options can produce significant amounts of logging output.

	#  modules, for all kinds of connection-related activity.
	#
	pool {
		#
		#  start:: Connections to create during module instantiation.
		#  If the server cannot create specified number of connections
		#  during instantiation it will exit.

		#
		#  max:: Maximum number of connections.
		#
		#  If these connections are all in use and a new one
		#  is requested, the request will NOT get a connection.
		#
		#  Setting `max` to LESS than the number of threads means
		#  that some threads may starve, and you will see errors
		#  like '_No connections available and at max connection limit_'
		#
		#  Setting `max` to MORE than the number of threads means
		#  that there are more connections than necessary.
		#
		max = ${thread[pool].num_workers}

		#
		#  spare:: Spare connections to be left idle.
		#
		#  NOTE: Idle connections *WILL* be closed if `idle_timeout`
		#  is set.  This should be less than or equal to `max` above.
		#
		spare = 1

		#
		#  uses:: Number of uses before the connection is closed.
		#
		#  NOTE: `0` means "infinite".
		#
		uses = 0

		#
		#  lifetime:: The lifetime (in seconds) of the connection.
		#
		#  NOTE: A setting of `0` means infinite (no limit).
		#
		lifetime = 0

		#
		#  idle_timeout:: The idle timeout (in seconds).  A connection which is
		#  unused for this length of time will be closed.
		#
		#  NOTE: A setting of `0` means infinite (no timeout).
		#
		idle_timeout = 1200

		#
		#  connect_timeout:: Connection timeout (in seconds).  The maximum amount of
		#  time to wait for a new connection to be established.
		#
		connect_timeout = 3.0

		#  [WARNING]
		#  ====
		#  All configuration settings are enforced.  If a
		#  connection is closed because of `idle_timeout`,
		#  `uses`, or `lifetime`, then the total number of
		#  connections *MAY* fall below `min`.  When that
		#  happens, it will open a new connection.  It will
		#  also log a *WARNING* message.
		#
		#  The solution is to either lower the `min` connections,
		#  or increase `lifetime`/`idle_timeout`.

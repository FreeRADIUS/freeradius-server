#  = Passwd Module
#
#  The `passwd` module seaches a passwd-like file, and extracts
#  attributes it.
#
#  See the `smbpasswd` and `etc_group` files for more examples.
#

#  ## Configuration Settings
#
#  An example configuration for using `/etc/passwd`.
#
#  This is an example which will NOT WORK if you have shadow passwords,
#  NIS, etc.  The `unix` module is normally responsible for reading
#  system passwords.  You should use it instead of this example.
#
passwd etc_passwd {
	#
	#  filename:: Path to the file which the module will read
	#
	filename = /etc/passwd

	#
	#  delimiter::
	#
	#  Symbol to use as a field separator in passwd file.
	#
	#  WARNING: The symbols `\0` and `\n` are not allowed.
	#
	#  The Default is `:`
	#
#	delimiter = ":"

	#
	#  format::
	#
	#  This parameters correlates record in the `passwd` file and RADIUS
	#  attributes.
	#
	#  * Field marked as `*` is a key field. That is, the parameter with
	#  this name from the request is used to search for the record from
	#  passwd file.
	#
	#  * Attributes marked as `=` are added to the `&reply:` list,
	#  instead of default `&control:` list.
	#
	#  * Attributes marked as `~` are added to the `&request:` list.
	#
	#  * Field marked as `,` may contain a comma separated list of attributes.
	#
	#  The format here uses the first field as the key.  If the
	#  `User-Name` matches, the `Crypt-Password` attribute is
	#  created from the second field, and is added to the
	#  `&control:` list.
	#
	format = "*User-Name:Crypt-Password:"

	#
	#  hash_size::
	#
	#  A future version of the server will have the module automatically
	#  determine the hash size.  Having it set manually should not be
	#  necessary.  It should be set to 50% of the number of lines in the file.
	#
	#  WARNING: The value must be larger than zero.
	#
	hash_size = 100

	#
	#  ignore_nislike:: Ignore NIS-related records.
	#
	ignore_nislike = no

	#
	#  allow_multiple_keys:: Control whether or not many records for a key are allowed.
	#
	#  If set to `yes`, then the module processes all matching
	#  entries.  If set to `no`, the module processes only the
	#  first matching entry.
	#
	allow_multiple_keys = no

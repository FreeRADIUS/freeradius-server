#  = Microsoft CHAP authentication Module
#
#  The `mschap` module performs `MS-CHAP` and `MS-CHAPv2` authentication.
#
#  MS-CHAP authentication requires access to either the
#  Password.Cleartext or NT-Password attribute for the user.  Due to
#  the limitations of MS-CHAP, no other password "encryption" methods
#  are possible.
#
#  This module validates a user with `MS-CHAP` or `MS-CHAPv2` authentication.
#  If called in `recv Access-Request`, it will look for `MS-CHAP` Challenge/Response
#  attributes in the `request` list and adds an `Auth-Type` attribute set to
#  `mschap` in the Config-Items list unless Auth-Type has already set.
#
#  The module also enforces the `SMB-Account-Ctrl` attribute. See the
#  Samba documentation for the meaning of SMB account control. The
#  module does not read Samba password files. Instead, the rlm_passwd
#  module can be used to read a Samba password file, and then supply
#  an `NT-Password` attribute which this module can use.
#

#
#  ## Configuration Settings
#
#  NOTE: If you are using `/etc/smbpasswd`, see the `passwd` module
#  for an example of how to use `/etc/smbpasswd`
#
mschap {
	#
	#  normalise::
	#
	#  By default the server will use heuristics to try and automatically
	#  handle base64 or hex encoded passwords or hashes.
	#  This behaviour can be disabled by setting the following to `no`.
	#
	#  The default is `yes`
	#
#	normalise = no

	#
	#  use_mppe::
	#
	#  By default the `mschap` will add `MS-CHAP-MPPE-Keys` for `MS-CHAPv1` and
	#  `MS-MPPE-Recv-Key` and `MS-MPPE-Send-Key` for `MS-CHAPv2`.  Set this
	#  configuration item to `no` in order to not add the MPPE keys.
	#
	#  Default is `yes`.
	#
#	use_mppe = no

	#
	#  require_encryption::
	#
	#  if `use_mppe` is enabled, the `require_encryption` makes encryption moderate.
	#
	#  Default is `no`.
	#
#	require_encryption = yes

	#
	#  require_strong::
	#
	#  It always requires 128 bit key encryption.
	#
	#  Default is `no`.
	#
#	require_strong = yes

	#
	#  with_ntdomain_hack:: Windows clients send `User-Name` in the form of "DOMAIN\User",
	#  but send the challenge/response based only on the User portion.
	#
	#  Default is `yes`.
	#
#	with_ntdomain_hack = no

	#
	#  ntlm_auth:: Path and arguments to the `ntlm_auth` program.
	#
	#  The module can perform authentication itself, OR
	#  use a Windows Domain Controller.  This configuration
	#  directive tells the module to call the `ntlm_auth`
	#  program, which will do the authentication, and return
	#  the `NT-Key`.
	#
	#  NOTE: you MUST have the such services "winbindd" and "nmbd"
	#  running on the local machine for `ntlm_auth` to work.
	#
	#  See the `ntlm_auth` program documentation for details.
	#
	#  If `ntlm_auth` is configured below, then the `mschap` module
	#  will call `ntlm_auth` for every `MS-CHAP` authentication request.
	#
	#  If there is a cleartext or NT hashed password available, you can set
	#  `MS-CHAP-Use-NTLM-Auth := No` in the control items, and the `mschap`
	#  module will do the authentication itself, without calling `ntlm_auth`.
	#
	#  You can also try setting the user name as:
	#
	#  `... --username=%{mschap:User-Name} ...`
	#
	#  In that case, the `mschap` module will look at the `User-Name`
	#  attribute, and do prefix/suffix checks in order to obtain the _best_
	#  user name for the request.
	#
	#  Depending on the AD / Samba configuration, you may also need to add:
	#
	#  `--allow-mschapv2`
	#
	#  to the list of command-line options.
	#
	#  WARNING: Be VERY careful when editing the following line!
	#  Change the path, and ideally nothing else.
	#
#	ntlm_auth = "/path/to/ntlm_auth --request-nt-key --username=%{%{Stripped-User-Name}:-%{%{User-Name}:-None}} --challenge=%{%{mschap:Challenge}:-00} --nt-response=%{%{mschap:NT-Response}:-00}"

	#
	#  ntlm_auth_timeout:: Time to wait for `ntlm_auth` to run.
	#
	#  This is a long time, and if `ntlm_auth` is taking that long
	#  then you likely have other problems in your domain.
	#
	#  The length of time can be decreased with the following
	#  option, which can save clients waiting if your `ntlm_auth`
	#  usually finishes quicker.
	#
	#  Range `1` to `10` seconds.
	#
	#  Default is `10` seconds.
	#
#	ntlm_auth_timeout = 10

	#
	#  winbind { ...}:: Configuration options for talking to Winbind.
	#
	winbind {
		#
		#  username:: User name for winbind
		#  domain:: Domain name for winbind
		#
		#  An alternative to using `ntlm_auth` is to connect to the
		#  winbind daemon directly for authentication. This option
		#  is likely to be faster and may be useful on busy systems.
		#
		#  Performance seems to be about twice that of `ntlm_auth`,
		#  which still isn't a lot.
		#
		#  Using this option requires libwbclient from Samba 4.2.1 or
		#  later to be installed. Make sure that `ntlm_auth` above is
		#  commented out.
		#
#		username = "%{mschap:User-Name}"
#		domain = "%{mschap:NT-Domain}"

		#
		#  retry_with_normalised_username::
		#
		#  When using single sign-on with a winbind connection and the
		#  client uses a different casing for the username than the
		#  casing is according to the backend, reauth may fail because
		#  of some Windows internals.
		#  This switch tries to find the user in the correct casing in
		#  the backend, and retry authentication with that username.
		#
#		retry_with_normalised_username = no
	}

	#  .Pool
	#

	#  which use the connection pool.

		#

		#
		#  Connections to create during module instantiation.
		#  If the server cannot create specified number of
		#  connections during instantiation it will exit.

		#  min::

		#
		min = ${thread[pool].num_workers}

		#
		#  max:: Maximum number of connections.
		#
		#  If these connections are all in use and a new one
		#  is requested, the request will NOT get a connection.
		#
		#  Setting `max` to LESS than the number of threads means
		#  that some threads may starve, and you will see errors
		#  like 'No connections available and at max connection limit'
		#
		#  Setting `max` to MORE than the number of threads means
		#  that there are more connections than necessary.
		#
		max = ${thread[pool].num_workers}

		#
		#  spare:: Spare connections to be left idle.
		#
		#  NOTE: Idle connections WILL be closed if `idle_timeout`
		#  is set. This should be less than or equal to `max` above.
		#
		spare = 1

		#
		#  uses:: Number of uses before the connection is closed.
		#
		#  0 means "infinite"
		#
		uses = 0

		#
		#  retry_delay::
		#
		#  The number of seconds to wait after the server tries
		#  to open a connection, and fails.  During this time,
		#  no new connections will be opened.
		#
		retry_delay = 30

		#
		#  lifetime::
		#
		#  The lifetime (in seconds) of the connection.
		#
		#  NOTE: A setting of 0 means infinite (no limit).
		#
		lifetime = 86400

		#
		#  cleanup_interval::
		#
		#  The pool is checked for free connections every
		#  `cleanup_interval`.  If there are free connections,
		#  then one of them is closed.
		#
		cleanup_interval = 300

		#
		#  idle_timeout::
		#
		#  The idle timeout (in seconds).  A connection which is
		#  unused for this length of time will be closed.
		#
		#  NOTE: A setting of `0` means infinite (no timeout).
		#
		idle_timeout = 600

		#
		#  [NOTE]
		#  ====
		#  All configuration settings are enforced.  If a
		#  connection is closed because of `idle_timeout`,
		#  `uses`, or `lifetime`, then the total number of
		#  connections MAY fall below `min`.  When that
		#  happens, it will open a new connection.  It will
		#  also log a WARNING message.
		#
		#  The solution is to either lower the `min` connections,
		#  or increase lifetime/idle_timeout.

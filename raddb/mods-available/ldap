#  = LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) Module
#
#  The `ldap` module allows LDAP directory entries to be retrieved, modified,
#  inserted and deleted.
#
#  NOTE: May also perform user authentication using LDAP binds, or by retrieving
#  the contents of a password attribute for later comparison by a module such
#  as `pap`, or an `eap` method.
#

#
#  ## Configuration Settings
#
#  ldap { ... }::
#
ldap {
	#
	#  server::
	#
	#  Note that this needs to match the name(s) in the LDAP server
	#  certificate, if you're using ldaps.  See OpenLDAP documentation
	#  for the behavioral semantics of specifying more than one host.
	#
	#  Depending on the `libldap` in use, server may be specified as an LDAP
	#  URI.  In the case of `OpenLDAP` this allows additional the following
	#  additional schemes:
	#
	#  [options="header,autowidth"]
	#  |===
	#  | Scheme   | Description
	#  | ldaps:// | (LDAP over SSL)
	#  | ldapi:// | (LDAP over Unix socket)
	#  | ldapc:// | (Connectionless LDAP)
	#  |===
	#
	server = 'localhost'
#	server = 'ldap.rrdns.example.org'
#	server = 'ldap.rrdns.example.org'

	#
	#  port:: Port to connect on, defaults to 389, will be ignored for LDAP URIs.
	#
#	port = 389

	#
	#  identity::  Administrator account for searching and possibly modifying.
	#
	#  WARNING: If using SASL + KRB5 these should be commented out.
	#
#	identity = 'cn=admin,dc=example,dc=org'

	#
	#  password:: Password for the `identity` account.
	#
#	password = mypass

	#
	#  base_dn:: Unless overridden in another section, the dn from which all
	#  searches will start from.
	#
	base_dn = 'dc=example,dc=org'

	#
	#  [NOTE]
	#  ====
	#  You can run the `ldapsearch` command line tool using the
	#  parameters from this module's configuration.
	#
	#    ldapsearch -D ${identity} -w ${password} -h ${server} -b 'CN=user,${base_dn}'
	#
	#  That will give you the LDAP information for 'user'.
	#
	#  Group membership can be queried by using the above "ldapsearch" string,
	#  and adding "memberof" qualifiers.  For ActiveDirectory, use:
	#
	#    ldapsearch ... '(&(objectClass=user)(sAMAccountName=user)(memberof=CN=group,${base_dn}))'
	#
	#  Where 'user' is the user as above, and 'group' is the group you are querying for.
	#  ====
	#

	#
	#  ### SASL parameters to use for admin binds
	#
	#  sasl { ... }::
	#
	#  When we're prompted by the SASL library, the config items in the SASL
	#  section (in addition to the identity password config items above)
	#  determine the responses given.
	#
	#  If any directive is commented out, a NULL response will be
	#  provided to cyrus-sasl.
	#
	#  Unfortunately the only way to control Keberos here is through
	#  environmental variables, as cyrus-sasl provides no API to
	#  set the kerberos (libkrb5) config directly.
	#
	#  Full documentation for MIT krb5 can be
	#  found at http://web.mit.edu/kerberos/krb5-devel/doc/admin/env_variables.html
	#
	#  At a minimum you probably want to set `KRB5_CLIENT_KTNAME`.
	#
	sasl {
		#
		#  mech:: SASL mechanism.
		#
#		mech = 'PLAIN'

		#
		#  proxy:: SASL authorisation identity to proxy.
		#
#		proxy = 'autz_id'

		#
		#  realm:: SASL realm. Used for kerberos.
		#
#		realm = 'example.org'
	}

	#
	#  ### Generic valuepair attribute
	#
	#  If set, this will attribute will be retrieved in addition to any
	#  mapped attributes.
	#
	#  Values should be in the format:
	#
	#    <fr attr> <op> <value>
	#
	#  Where:
	#
	#  [options="header,autowidth"]
	#  |===
	#  | Parameter  | Description
	#  | <fr attr>  | Is the attribute you wish to create,
	#                 with any valid list and request qualifiers.
	#  | <op>       | Is any assignment operator (`=`, `:=`, `+=`, `-=`).
	#  | <value>    | Is the value to parse into the new attribute.
	#                 If the value is wrapped in double quotes it
	#                 will be xlat expanded.
	#  |===
	#
#	valuepair_attribute = 'radiusAttribute'

	#
	#  ### Global
	#
	global {
		#
		#  random_file:: Provides random number generator.
		#
#		random_file = /dev/urandom

		#
		#  ldap_debug:: Debug flags for libldap (see OpenLDAP documentation).
		#
		#  .Please see the option 'ldap_debug'
		#
#		ldap_debug = 0x0000
	}

	#
	#  ### Mapping of LDAP directory attributes to RADIUS dictionary attributes.
	#
	#  WARNING: Although this format is almost identical to the `unlang`
	#  update section format, it does *NOT* mean that you can use other
	#  `unlang` constructs in module configuration files.
	#
	#  Configuration items are in the format:
	#
	#    <fr attr> <op> <ldap attr>
	#
	#  Where:
	#
	#  [options="header,autowidth"]
	#  |===
	#  | Parameter   | Description
	#  | <fr attr>   | Is the destination RADIUS attribute
	#                  with any valid list and request qualifiers.
	#  | <op>        | Is any assignment attribute (=, :=, +=, -=).
	#  | <ldap attr> | Is the attribute associated with user or
	#                  profile objects in the LDAP directory.
	#                  If the attribute name is wrapped in double quotes
	#                  it will be `xlat` expanded.
	#  |===
	#
	#  Request and list qualifiers may be placed after the `update`
	#  section name to set default destination requests/lists
	#  for `<fr attr>s` with no list qualifiers.
	#
	#  NOTE: LDAP attribute names should be single quoted unless you want
	#  the name to be derived from an xlat expansion, or an attribute ref.
	#
	#  update { ... }::
	#
	update {
		&control.Password.With-Header	+= 'userPassword'
#		&control.NT-Password		:= 'ntPassword'
#		&reply.Reply-Message		:= 'radiusReplyMessage'
#		&reply.Tunnel-Type		:= 'radiusTunnelType'
#		&reply.Tunnel-Medium-Type	:= 'radiusTunnelMediumType'
#		&reply.Tunnel-Private-Group-ID	:= 'radiusTunnelPrivategroupId'

		#  NOTE: Where only a list is specified as the RADIUS attribute,
		#  the value of the LDAP attribute is parsed as a valuepair
		#  in the same format as the 'valuepair_attribute' (above).
		&control			+= 'radiusControlAttribute'
		&request			+= 'radiusRequestAttribute'
		&reply				+= 'radiusReplyAttribute'
	}

	#
	#  edir:: Set to `yes` if you have eDirectory and want to use the universal
	#  password mechanism.
	#
#	edir = no

	#
	#  edir_autz:: Set to `yes` if you want to bind as the user after retrieving the
	#  `Password.Cleartext`. This will consume the login grace, and verify user authorization.
	#
#	edir_autz = no

	#
	#  [NOTE]
	#  ====
	#  * The option `set_auth_type` was removed in `v3.x.x`.
	#  * Equivalent functionality can be achieved by adding the following
	#    stanza to the `recv Access-Request {}` section of your virtual server.
	#
	#  e.g:
	#
	#  [source, unlang]
	#  ----
	#  ldap
	#  if ((ok || updated) && &User-Password) {
	#  	update {
	#  		&control.Auth-Type := ldap
	#  	}
	#  }
	#  ----

	#  ### User object Identification
	#
	user {
		#
		#  base_dn:: Where to start searching in the tree for users.
		#
		base_dn = "${..base_dn}"

		#
		#  filter:: Filter for user objects, should be specific enough
		#  to identify a single user object.
		#
		filter = "(uid=%{%{Stripped-User-Name}:-%{User-Name}})"

		#  For Active Directory nested group, you should comment out the previous 'filter = ...'
		#  and use the below. Where 'group' is the group you are querying for.
		#
		#  NOTE: The string '1.2.840.113556.1.4.1941' specifies LDAP_MATCHING_RULE_IN_CHAIN.
		#  This applies only to DN attributes. This is an extended match operator that walks
		#  the chain of ancestry in objects all the way to the root until it finds a match.
		#  This reveals group nesting. It is available only on domain controllers with
		#  Windows Server 2003 SP2 or Windows Server 2008 (or above).
		#
		#  See: https://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/5392.active-directory-ldap-syntax-filters.aspx
		#
#		filter = "(&(objectClass=user)(sAMAccountName=%{%{Stripped-User-Name}:-%{User-Name}})(memberOf:1.2.840.113556.1.4.1941:=cn=group,${..base_dn}))"

		#
		#  sasl { ... }:: SASL parameters to use for user binds
		#
		#  When we're prompted by the SASL library, these control
		#  the responses given.
		#
		#  NOTE: Any of the config items below may be an attribute ref
		#  or and expansion.  This allows different SASL mechs,
		#  proxy IDs and realms to be used for different users.
		#
		sasl {
			#
			#  mech:: SASL mechanism.
			#
#			mech = 'PLAIN'

			#
			#  proxy:: SASL authorisation identity to proxy.
			#
#			proxy = &User-Name

			#
			#  realm:: SASL realm. Used for kerberos.
			#
#			realm = 'example.org'
		}

		#
		#  scope:: Search scope, may be `base`, `one`, `sub' or `children`.
		#
#		scope = 'sub'

		#
		#  sort_by:: Server side result sorting.
		#
		#  A list of space delimited attributes to order the result set by.
		#
		#  * If the filter matches multiple objects only the first
		#  result will be processed.
		#
		#  * If the attribute name is prefixed with a hyphen '-' the
		#  sorting order will be reversed for that attribute.
		#
		#  * If `sort_by` is set, and the server does not support sorting
		#  the search will fail.
		#
		#  * If a search returns multiple user objects and `sort_by` is not
		#  set, the search will fail.
		#
#		sort_by = '-uid'

		#
		#  access_attribute:: If this is undefined, anyone is authorised.
		#
		#  If it is defined, the contents of this attribute determine whether
		#  or not the user is authorised.
		#
#		access_attribute = 'dialupAccess'

		#
		#  access_positive:: Control whether the presence of `access_attribute`
		#  allows access, or denies access.
		#
		#  * If `yes`, and the `access_attribute` is present, or `no` and the
		#  `access_attribute` is absent then access  will be allowed.
		#
		#  * If `yes`, and the `access_attribute` is absent, or `no` and the
		#  `access_attribute` is present, then access will not be allowed.
		#
		#  * If the value of the retrieved `access_attribute` is `false`, it will
		#  negate the result.
		#
		#  e.g:
		#
		#    access_positive = yes
		#    access_attribute = userAccessAllowed
		#
		#  With an LDAP object containing:
		#
		#    userAccessAllowed: false
		#
		#  Will result in the user being locked out.
		#
#		access_positive = yes
	}

	#
	#  ### User membership checking
	#
	group {
		#
		#  base_dn:: Where to start searching in the tree for groups.
		#
		base_dn = "${..base_dn}"

		#
		#  filter:: Filter for group objects, should match all available
		#  group objects a user might be a member of.
		#
		#  If using Active Directory you are likely to need `group`
		#  instead of `posixGroup`.
		#
		filter = '(objectClass=posixGroup)'

		#
		#  scope:: Search scope, may be `base`, `one`, `sub` or `children`.
		#
#		scope = 'sub'

		#
		#  name_attribute:: Attribute that uniquely identifies a group.
		#
		#  Is used when converting group DNs to group names.
		#
#		name_attribute = cn

		#
		#  membership_filter:: Filter to find all group objects a user is a member of.
		#
		#  That is, group objects with attributes that identify
		#  members (the inverse of `membership_attribute`).
		#
#		membership_filter = "(|(member=%{control.Ldap-UserDn})(memberUid=%{%{Stripped-User-Name}:-%{User-Name}}))"

		#
		#  membership_attribute:: The attribute, in user objects, which contain
		#  the names or DNs of groups a user is a member of.
		#
		#  Unless a conversion between group name and group DN is
		#  needed, there's no requirement for the group objects
		#  referenced to actually exist.
		#
		#  [NOTE]
		#  ====
		#  If the LDAP server does not support the `memberOf` attribute (or equivalent),
		#  then you will need to use the membership_filter option above instead.
		#  If you can't see the `memberOf` attribute then it is also possible that the
		#  LDAP bind user does not have the correct permissions to view it.
		#  ====
		#
		membership_attribute = 'memberOf'

		#
		#  cacheable_name:: If `cacheable_name` or `cacheable_dn` are enabled,
		#  all group information for the user will be retrieved from the directory
		#  and written to `LDAP-Group` attributes appropriate for the instance of rlm_ldap.
		#
		#  For group comparisons these attributes will be checked instead of querying
		#  the LDAP directory directly.
		#
		#  This feature is intended to be used with `rlm_cache`, but may also be useful
		#  if all group values need to be processed using `unlang` policies.
		#
		#  If you wish to use this feature, you should enable the type that matches the
		#  format of your check items.
		#
		#  i.e. if your groups are specified as DNs then enable `cacheable_dn`
		#  else enable `cacheable_name`.
		#
#		cacheable_name = 'no'

		#
		#  cacheable_dn:: See `cacheable_name` for more details.
		#
#		cacheable_dn = 'no'

		#
		#  cache_attribute:: Override the normal cache attribute (`<inst>-LDAP-Group` or
		#  `LDAP-Group` if using the default instance) and create a custom attribute.
		#
		#  This can help if multiple module instances are used in fail-over.
		#
#		cache_attribute = 'LDAP-Cached-Membership'

		#
		#  allow_dangling_group_ref::
		#
		#  If the group being checked is specified as a name, but the user's groups are
		#  referenced by DN, and one of those group DNs is invalid, the whole group check
		#  is treated as invalid, and a negative result will be returned.
		#
		#  When set to `yes`, this option ignores invalid DN references.
		#
#		allow_dangling_group_ref = 'no'

		#
		#  group_attribute:: Override the normal group comparison attribute name
		#  `(<inst>-Group` or `LDAP-Group` if using the default instance).
		#
		group_attribute = "${..:instance}-Group"
	}

	#
	#  ### User profiles
	#
	#  RADIUS profile objects contain sets of attributes to insert into the request.
	#  These attributes are mapped using the same mapping scheme applied to user
	#  objects (the update section above).
	#
	profile {
		#
		#  filter:: Filter for RADIUS profile objects.
		#
#		filter = '(objectclass=radiusprofile)'

		#
		#  default:: The default profile. This may be a DN or an attribute reference.
		#
		#  NOTE: To get old v2.2.x style behaviour, or to use the `&User-Profile` attribute
		#  to specify the default profile, set this to `&control.User-Profile`.
		#
#		default = 'cn=radprofile,dc=example,dc=org'

		#
		#  attribute:: The LDAP attribute containing profile DNs to apply
		#  in addition to the default profile above.
		#
		#  These are retrieved from the user object, at the same time as the
		#  attributes from the update section, are are applied if authorization
		#  is successful.
		#
#		attribute = 'radiusProfileDn'
	}

	#
	#  ### Modify user object on receiving Accounting-Request
	#
	#  Useful for recording things like the last time the user logged
	#  in, or the `Acct-Session-ID` for CoA/DM.
	#
	#  LDAP modification items are in the format:
	#
	#    <ldap attr> <op> <value>
	#
	#  Where:
	#
	#  [options="header,autowidth"]
	#  |===
	#  | Parameter   | Description
	#  | <ldap attr> | The LDAP attribute to add modify or delete.
	#  | <op>        | One of the assignment operators: (`:=`, `+=`, `-=`, `++`).
	#                  Note: `=` is *not* supported.
	#  | <value>     | The value to add modify or delete.
	#  |===
	#
	#  WARNING: If using the `:=` operator with a multi-valued LDAP
	#  attribute, all instances of the attribute will be removed and
	#  replaced with a single attribute.

	#  ### TLS encrypted connections
	#
	#  This subsection configures the `tls` related items that control how FreeRADIUS
	#  connects to an LDAP server. It contains all of the `tls_*` configuration entries

	#  ### Connection Pool
	#
	#  The connection pool is new for >= 3.0, and will be used in many
	#  modules, for all kinds of connection-related activity.
	#

		#  ====
		#  All configuration settings are enforced.  If a
		#  connection is closed because of `idle_timeout`,
		#  `uses`, or `lifetime`, then the total number of
		#  connections MAY fall below `min`.  When that
		#  happens, it will open a new connection.  It will
		#  also log a WARNING message.
		#
		#  The solution is to either lower the `min` connections,
		#  or increase lifetime/idle_timeout.

	#  for the behavioral semantics of specifying more than one host.
	#
	#  Depending on the libldap in use, server may be an LDAP URI.
	#  In the case of OpenLDAP this allows additional the following
	#  additional schemes:
	#  - ldaps:// (LDAP over SSL)
	#  - ldapi:// (LDAP over Unix socket)
	#  - ldapc:// (Connectionless LDAP)

	#  If using SASL + KRB5 these should be commented out.
#	identity = 'cn=admin,dc=example,dc=org'
#	password = mypass

	#  Unless overridden in another section, the dn from which all
	#  searches will start from.
	base_dn = 'dc=example,dc=org'

	#
	#  You can run the 'ldapsearch' command line tool using the
	#  parameters from this module's configuration.
	#
	#    ldapsearch -D ${identity} -w ${password} -h ${server}  -b 'CN=user,${base_dn}'
	#
	#  That will give you the LDAP information for 'user'.
	#
	#  Group membership can be queried by using the above "ldapsearch" string,
	#  and adding "memberof" qualifiers.  For ActiveDirectory, use:
	#
	#    ldapsearch ... '(&(objectClass=user)(sAMAccountName=user)(memberof=CN=group,${base_dn}))'

	#  provided to cyrus-sasl.

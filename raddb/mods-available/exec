#  = Exec Module
#
#  The module `exec` is used for executing external programs.
#
#  This module is useful only for `xlat`.  To use it, put `exec` into
#  the `instantiate` section.  You can then do dynamic translation of
#  attributes like:
#
#    Attribute-Name = "%{exec:/path/to/program args}"
#
#  The value of the attribute will be replaced with the output of the
#  program which is executed.  Due to RADIUS protocol limitations,
#  any output over `253` bytes will be ignored.
#
#  The RADIUS attributes from the user request will be placed
#  into environment variables of the executed program, as
#  described in `man unlang` and in `doc/unlang/xlat.adoc`
#
#  The return value of the program run determines the result of the exec
#  instance call as follows:
#
#  [options="header,autowidth"]
#  |===
#  | Code | Return    | Description
#  | < 0  | fail      | the module failed.
#  | = 0  | ok        | the module succeeded.
#  | = 1  | reject    | the module rejected the user.
#  | = 2  | fail      | the module failed.
#  | = 3  | ok        | the module succeeded.
#  | = 4  | handled   | the module has done everything to handle the request.
#  | = 5  | invalid   | the user's configuration entry was invalid.
#  | = 6  | userlock  | the user was locked out.
#  | = 7  | notfound  | the user was not found.
#  | = 8  | noop      | the module did nothing.
#  | = 9  | updated   | the module updated information in the request.
#  | > 9  | fail      | the module failed.
#  |===
#

#
#  ## Configuration Settings
#
exec {
	#
	#  wait:: Wait for the program to finish.
	#
	#  If we do NOT wait, then the program is "fire and
	#  forget", and any output attributes from it are ignored.
	#
	wait = yes

	#
	#  program:: The name of the program to execute, and it's
	#  arguments.
	#
	#  Dynamic translation is done on this field, so things like
	#  the following example will work.
	#
	#  If 'program' is set to a value, then the module *cannot* be
	#  used in an `xlat`.  See the `echo` module for examples of
	#  how to use the module "in line".
	#
#	program = "/bin/true %{User-Name}"

	#
	#  input_pairs:: The attributes which are placed into the
	#  environment variables for the program.
	#
	#  Allowed values are:
	#
	#  [options="header,autowidth"]
	#  |===
	#  | Pairs         | Description
	#  | request       | attributes from the request
	#  | config        | attributes from the configuration items list
	#  | reply         | attributes from the reply
	#  | proxy-request | attributes from the proxy request
	#  | proxy-reply   | attributes from the proxy reply
	#  |===
	#
	#  NOTE: Some attributes may not exist at some stages.
	#  e.g. There may be no proxy-reply attributes if this module is used
	#  in the `recv` section.
	#
	input_pairs = request

	#
	#  output_pairs::: Where to place the output attributes (if any) from
	#  the executed program.
	#
	#  The values allowed, and the restrictions as to availability, are the
	#  same as for the `input_pairs`.
	#
	#  This configuration item is used only when the `program`
	#  configuration item is set, and when `wait = yes` is set.
	#
#	output_pairs = reply

	#
	#  shell_escape:: Escape the environment variables.
	#
	#  If this is set, all the RADIUS attributes are capitalised and dashes
	#  replaced with underscores. Also, RADIUS values are surrounded with
	#  double-quotes.
	#
	#  That is to say:
	#
	#    User-Name=BobUser => USER_NAME="BobUser"
	#
	shell_escape = yes

	#
	#  timeout:: Set a time wait for the program to finish.
	#
	#  Default is `10` seconds, which should be plenty for nearly
	#  anything. Range is `1` to `30` seconds.
	#
	#  WARNING: You are strongly encouraged to NOT increase this
	#  value.  In fact, you are much better off decreasing it to a
	#  lower value.  Doing so will improve network stability and
	#  responsiveness.
	#
	timeout = 10
}

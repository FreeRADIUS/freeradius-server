#  = Unbound Module
#
#  The `unbound` module performs queries against a DNS service to allow
#  FQDNs to be resolved during request processing.
#

#
#  ## Configuration Settings
#
unbound dns {
	#
	#  File to read unbound configuration details from.
	#
	#  filename = "${raddbdir}/mods-config/unbound/default.conf"

	#
	#  Timeout for unbound queries.
	#
	#  timeout = 3000

	#
	#  resolv.conf file to instruct unbound to load resolvers from.
	#  Defaults to not set.
	#  Without this set, unbound queries root DNS servers.  If a local
	#  caching DNS server is available that will improve performance.
	#
	#  resolvconf = "/etc/resolv.conf"

	#
	#  hosts file to load data from.  Defaults to not set.
	#
	#  hosts = "/etc/hosts"
}

#
#  ## xlat for DNS resolution
#
#  An xlat based on the instance name can be used to perform DNS lookups.
#
#  .Example
#
#  ```
#  %(dns:www.example.com A)
#  %(dns:www.example.com AAAA)
#  ```
#
#  Given an instance `dns` the above xlats will perform A record and
#  AAAA record lookups on www.example.com.
#
#  .Example
#
#  ```
#  %(dns:1.1.168.192.in-addr.arpa PTR)
#  ```
#
#  The above example will perform reverse DNS lookup on 192.168.1.1
#
#  .Example
#
#  ```
#  %(dns:example.com MX 1)
#  ```
#
#  The above example will perform an MX lookup on example.com returning
#  just the first result.

#  = Files Module
#
#  The `users` file as located in `raddb/mods-config/files/authorize`. (Livingston-style format).
#
#  See the doc/antora/modules/raddb/pages/mods-config/files/users.adoc file documentation for information
#  on the format of the input file, and how it operates.
#

#
#  ## Configuration Settings
#
files {
	#
	#  moddir:: Search for files in a subdirectory of mods-config which
	#  matches this instance of the files module.
	#
	moddir = ${modconfdir}/${.:instance}

	#
	#  key:: The default key attribute to use for matches.
	#
	#  The content of this attribute is used to match the `name` of the entry.
	#
	#  Note that unlike v4, the key does not have to be a string, but could instead
	#  be an IP address or netmask!  For more information, see
	#
	#	doc/antora/modules/raddb/pages/mods-config/files/users.adoc 
	#
#	key = "%{&Stripped-User-Name || &User-Name}"

	#
	#  filename:: The old `users` style file is now located here.
	#
	filename = ${moddir}/authorize

	#
	#  match_attr:: List and attribute to populate with the `name` of the matched entry.
	#
	#  Note: the attriubte type should be capable of holding data of the type
	#  used as key values.
	#  Particularly useful if matching IP addresses to subnets, since the populated
	#  value will be the subnet.  In that case it is best to use 0.0.0.0/0 in place
	#  of DEFAULT for any catch-all entries.
	#
#	match_attr = &control.User-Category
}

#
#  ## An instance of the `files` module for use in processing accounting packets
#
files files_accounting {
#	key = "%{&Stripped-User-Name || &User-Name}"
	filename = ${modconfdir}/files/accounting
}

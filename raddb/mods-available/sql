#  = SQL Module
#
#  The `sql` module handles configuration for the SQL drivers.
#
#  The database schemas and queries are located in subdirectories:
#
#  [options="header,autowidth"]
#  |===
#  | Directory                      | Description
#  | sql/<driver>/main/schema.sql	| Schema
#  | sql/<driver>/main/queries.conf	| Authorisation and Accounting queries
#  |===
#
#  Driver specific configuration options are located in `sql` prefix
#  config files in:
#
#    mods-config/sql/driver/<driver>
#
#  Where `<driver>` is cassandra, db2, firebird, freetds, null, mysql
#  oracle, postgresql, sqlite and unixodbc.
#

#
#  ## Configuration Settings
#
sql {
	#
	#  dialect:: The dialect of SQL you want to use.
	#
	#  Allowed dialects are:
	#
	#    * cassandra
	#    * mysql
	#    * mssql
	#    * oracle
	#    * postgresql
	#    * sqlite
	#
	dialect = "sqlite"

	#
	#  driver:: The sub-module to use to execute queries. It
	#  should usually match the `dialect` above.
	#
	#  In some cases, the driver is different from the `dialect`.
	#
	#  The rlm_sql_null driver can be used with any `dialect`,
	#  along with the `logfile` directive below.  It will then
	#  write the SQL queries to a log file.
	#
	#  For MS-SQL, there are multiple driver options, as given in
	#  the table below.  If the databases require syntax
	#  *different* from MS-SQL, please submit bug reports so that
	#  we can fix them,
	#

	#  When the server is not threaded, the connection pool limits are ignored, and only one
	#  connection is used.
	#
	#  [NOTE]
	#  ====
	#  If you want to have multiple SQL modules re-use the same connection pool, use `pool = name`
	#  instead of a `pool` section.
	#
	#  e.g:
	#
	#  [source,sql]
	#  ----
	#  sql sql1 {
	#   ...
	#   pool {
	#     ...
	#   }

	#  # sql2 will use the connection pool from sql1

	#  }
	#  ----

		#  If the server cannot create specified number of connections during instantiation

		#
		start = ${thread[pool].num_workers}

		#
		#  min:: Minimum number of connections to keep open.
		#
		min = ${thread[pool].num_workers}

		#
		#  max:: Maximum number of connections.
		#
		#  If these connections are all in use and a new one is requested, the request
		#  will NOT get a connection.
		#
		#  Setting `max` to LESS than the number of threads means that some threads may starve,
		#  and you will see errors like _No connections available and at max connection limit_.
		#
		#  Setting `max` to MORE than the number of threads means that there are more
		#  connections than necessary.
		#
		max = ${thread[pool].num_workers}

		#
		#  spare:: Spare connections to be left idle.
		#
		#  NOTE: Idle connections WILL be closed if `idle_timeout`
		#  is set.  This should be less than or equal to `max` above.
		#
		spare = 1

		#
		#  uses:: Number of uses before the connection is closed.
		#
		#  `0` means "infinite".
		#
		uses = 0

		#
		#  retry_delay:: The number of seconds to wait after the server tries
		#  to open a connection, and fails.
		#
		#  During this time, no new connections will be opened.
		#
		retry_delay = 30

		#
		#  lifetime:: The lifetime (in seconds) of the connection.
		#
		lifetime = 0

		#
		#  idle_timeout:: idle timeout (in seconds).
		#
		#  A connection which is unused for this length of time will be closed.
		#
		idle_timeout = 60

		#
		#  connect_timeout:: Connection timeout (in seconds).
		#
		#  The maximum amount of time to wait for a new connection to be established.

		#
		#  [options="header,autowidth"]
		#  |===
		#  | Driver             | Description
		#  | rlm_sql_firebird   | Likely possible but no documentation.
		#  | rlm_sql_oracle     | Not possible.
		#  | rlm_sql_postgresql | Should be set via the radius_db string instead.
		#  |===
		#
		connect_timeout = 3.0

		#
		#  [NOTE]
		#  ====
		#  * All configuration settings are enforced.  If a connection is closed because
		#  of `idle_timeout`, `uses`, or `lifetime`, then the total number of connections
		#  MAY fall below `min`.
		#  When that happens, it will open a new connection.  It will also log a WARNING message.
		#
		#  * The solution is to either lower the "min" connections, or increase lifetime/idle_timeout.

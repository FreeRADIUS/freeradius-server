#
#  Configuration for the SQL module
#
#  The database schemas and queries are located in subdirectories:
#
#	sql/<DB>/main/schema.sql	Schema
#	sql/<DB>/main/queries.conf	Authorisation and Accounting queries
#
#  Where "DB" is mysql, mssql, oracle, or postgresql.
#
#  The name used to query SQL is sql_user_name, which is set in the file
#
#     raddb/mods-config/sql/main/${dialect}/queries.conf
#
#  If you are using realms, that configuration should be changed to use
#  the Stripped-User-Name attribute.  See the comments around sql_user_name
#  for more information.
#

sql {
	#
	#  The dialect of SQL being used.
	#
	#  Allowed dialects are:
	#
	#	mssql
	#	mysql
	#	oracle
	#	postgresql
	#	sqlite
	#	mongo
	#
	dialect = "sqlite"

	#
	#  The driver module used to execute the queries.  Since we
	#  don't know which SQL drivers are being used, the default is
	#  "rlm_sql_null", which just logs the queries to disk via the
	#  "logfile" directive, below.
	#
	#  In order to talk to a real database, delete the next line,
	#  and uncomment the one after it.
	#
	#  If the dialect is "mssql", then the driver should be set to
	#  one of the following values, depending on your system:
	#
	#	rlm_sql_db2
	#	rlm_sql_firebird
	#	rlm_sql_freetds
	#	rlm_sql_iodbc
	#	rlm_sql_unixodbc
	#
	driver = "rlm_sql_null"
#	driver = "rlm_sql_${dialect}"

	#
	#  Driver-specific subsections.  They will only be loaded and
	#  used if "driver" is something other than "rlm_sql_null".
	#  When a real driver is used, the relevant driver
	#  configuration section is loaded, and all other driver
	#  configuration sections are ignored.

		#  like 'No connections available and at max connection limit'
		#
		#  Setting 'max' to MORE than the number of threads means
		#  that there are more connections than necessary.
		#
		#  The setting here should be lower than the maximum

		#
		#  i.e. There is no point in telling FreeRADIUS to use
		#  64 connections, while the database is limited to 32
		#  connections.  That configuration will cause the
		#  server to be "starved" of connections, and it will
		#  block during normal operations, even when the
		#  database is largely idle.
		#
		#  At the same time, if the database is slow, there is
		#  no point in increasing "max".  More connections
		#  will just cause the database to run more slowly.

	#  that list.  The client { ...} ` configured in that list are

#  = SQL Module
#
#  The `sql` module handles configuration for the SQL drivers.
#
#  The database schemas and queries are located in subdirectories:
#
#  [options="header,autowidth"]
#  |===
#  | Directory                      | Description
#  | sql/<driver>/main/schema.sql	| Schema
#  | sql/<driver>/main/queries.conf	| Authorisation and Accounting queries
#  |===
#
#  Driver specific configuration options are located in `sql` prefix
#  config files in:
#
#    mods-config/sql/driver/<driver>
#
#  Where `<driver>` is cassandra, db2, firebird, freetds, null, mysql
#  oracle, postgresql, sqlite and unixodbc.
#
#  For authorization queries, the default schema mirrors the
#  functionality of the `files` module, including check items and
#  reply items.  See the
#  doc/antora/modules/raddb/pages/mods-config/files/users.adoc file
#  documentation for information on the format of the check items and
#  reply items.
#

#
#  ## Configuration Settings
#
sql {
	#
	#  dialect:: The dialect of SQL you want to use.
	#
	#  Allowed dialects are:
	#
	#    * cassandra
	#    * firebird
	#    * mysql
	#    * mssql
	#    * oracle
	#    * postgresql
	#    * sqlite
	#
	dialect = "sqlite"

	#
	#  driver:: The sub-module to use to execute queries. It
	#  should usually match the `dialect` above.
	#
	#  In some cases, the driver is different from the `dialect`.
	#
	#  The null driver can be used with any `dialect`,
	#  along with the `logfile` directive below.  It will then
	#  write the SQL queries to a log file.
	#
	#  For MS-SQL, there are multiple driver options, as given in
	#  the table below.  If the databases require syntax
	#  *different* from MS-SQL, please submit bug reports so that
	#  we can fix them,
	#

	#
	#  Following `check` and `reply` item handling and, depending on the `read_groups` option
	#  and `Fall-Through` value, groups processing, the SQL module will treat values of the

	#
	#  logfile:: Write SQL queries to a logfile.
	#
	#  This is potentially useful for tracing issues with authorization queries.
	#  See also `logfile` directives in `mods-config/sql/main/*/queries.conf`.
	#  You can enable per-section logging by enabling `logfile` there, or global logging by

	#  pool { ... }::
	#
	#  The connection pool is a set of per-thread parameters for connections to the SQL database.
	#
	#  If the driver supports it, then queries are run asynchronously.  Currently the list of
	#  drivers this applies to is:
	#
	#     * mysql
	#     * postgresql
	#     * unixodbc
	#     * oracle
	#     * cassandra
	#
	#  Other drivers are synchronous and therefore queries will block packet processing, resulting
	#  in significantly worse system performance.

		#
		#  min:: Minimum number of connections to keep open.
		#
		min = 1

		#
		#  max:: Maximum number of connections.
		#
		#  If these connections are all in use and a new one
		#  is requested, the request will NOT get a connection.
		#
		#  Since the majority of SQL drivers only allow one outstanding
		#  query per connection, this represents the maximum number of
		#  simultaneous packets that a thread can process.
		#
		#  Note: The maximum number of connections from FreeRADIUS to
		#  the database will be this number multiplied by the number of
		#  worker threads.  Ensure that the database server supports that
		#  number of connections.

#		manage_interval = 0.2

		#

		#
		#  Note:  Due to the one outstanding query per connection limit, the settings
		#  `per_connection_max` and `per_connection_target` are forcibly set to 1 for
		#  SQL database connections.

			#
			#  free_delay:: How long must a request in the unassigned (free) list not have been

			#  and freeing overheads.
			#
#			free_delay = 10
		}
	}

	#
	#  group_attribute:: The group attribute specific to this instance of `rlm_sql`.
	#
	#  The "group_membership_query" is used to select which groups the user is a member of.
	#
	#  The module loops over all groups, and places the group name into the "group_attribute".
	#
	#  The group attribute is used in the "authorize_group_check_query" and "authorize_group_check_query"
	#  to select entries which match that particular group.
	#
	#  After all groups in SQL have been run, the module looks for `&control.User-Profile`, and runs
	#  those profiles for "authorize_group_check_query" and "authorize_group_check_query".  i.e. a user
	#  profile is essentially a group.
	#
	#  These group queries can also update `&control.User-Profile`, which lets you have a group
	#  create a "fall through" to a DEFAULT group.  However, these groups are _not_ cross-checked against
	#  each other.  So it is possible to create loops, which is highly not recommended.
	#
	#  If caching is enabled, then the module is done looping over groups, the module adds the names of
	#  groups to the `control` list.  The "group_attribute" can then be used to check group membership.
	#  That check will be done internally, and will not result in a database lookup.  This also means that
	#  it is now possible to do group comparisons based on regular expressions.
	#
	#  It is possible to force a dynamic group lookup via the expansion `%sql.group(foo)`.  This
	#  expansion returns `true` if the user is a member of that SQL group, and `false` otherwise.
	#
	#  NOTE: The `SQL-Group` attribute is only available after the SQL module has been run.
	#
	#  The name of the group attribute is automatically determined from the module name.  By default, the
	#  name is `SQL-Group`.  if the module is an instance such as `sql sql1 { ... }`, then the name of the
	#  group attribute is `SQL1-Group`.
	#
	group_attribute = "${.:instance}-Group"

	#
	#  cache_groups:: whether or not we cache the list of SQL groups
	#
	#  The groups are cached in the `control` list.  So any comparisons must be done as
	#  `&control.SQL-Group = ...`
	#
	#  Default is `no`.
	#
#	cache_groups = no

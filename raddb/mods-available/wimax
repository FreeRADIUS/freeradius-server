#
#	The WiMAX module currently takes no configuration.
#
#	It should be listed in the "authorize" and "preacct" sections.
#	This enables the module to fix the horrible binary version
#	of Calling-Station-Id to the normal format, as specified in
#	RFC 3580, Section 3.21.
#
#	In order to calculate the various WiMAX keys, the module should
#	be listed in the "post-auth" section.  If EAP authentication
#	has been used, AND the EAP method derives MSK and EMSK, then
#	the various WiMAX keys can be calculated.
#
#	Some useful things to remember:
#
#	WiMAX-MSK = EAP MSK, but is 64 octets.
#
#	MIP-RK-1 = HMAC-SHA256(ESMK, "miprk@wimaxforum.org" | 0x00020001)
#	MIP-RK-2 = HMAC-SHA256(ESMK, MIP-RK-1 | "miprk@wimaxforum.org" | 0x00020002)
#	MIP-RK = MIP-RK-1 | MIP-RK-2
#
#	MIP-SPI = first 4 octets of HMAC-SHA256(MIP-RK, "SPI CMIP PMIP")
#		plus some magic... you've got to track *all* MIP-SPI's
#		on your system!
#
#	SPI-CMIP4 = MIP-SPI
#	SPI-PMIP4 = MIP-SPI + 1
#	SPI-CMIP6 = MIP-SPI + 2
#
#	MN-NAI is the Mobile node NAI.  You have to create it, and put
#	it into the request or reply as something like:
#
#		WiMAX-MN-NAI = "%{User-Name}"
#
#	You will also have to have the appropriate IP address (v4 or v6)
#	in order to calculate the keys below.
#
#	Lifetimes are derived from Session-Timeout.  It needs to be set
#	to some useful number.
#
#	The hash function below H() is HMAC-SHA1.
#
#
#	MN-HA-CMIP4 = H(MIP-RK, "CMIP4 MN HA" | HA-IPv4 | MN-NAI)
#
#		Where HA-IPv4 is	WiMAX-hHA-IP-MIP4
#		or maybe		WiMAX-vHA-IP-MIP4
#
#		Which goes into		WiMAX-MN-hHA-MIP4-Key
#		or maybe		WiMAX-RRQ-MN-HA-Key
#		or maybe even		WiMAX-vHA-MIP4-Key
#
#	The corresponding SPI is SPI-CMIP4, which is MIP-SPI,
#
#		which goes into		WiMAX-MN-hHA-MIP4-SPI
#		or maybe		WiMAX-RRQ-MN-HA-SPI
#		or even			WiMAX-MN-vHA-MIP4-SPI
#
#	MN-HA-PMIP4 = H(MIP-RK, "PMIP4 MN HA" | HA-IPv4 | MN-NAI)
#	MN-HA-CMIP6 = H(MIP-RK, "CMIP6 MN HA" | HA-IPv6 | MN-NAI)
#
#		both with similar comments to above for MN-HA-CMIP4.
#
#	In order to tell which one to use (CMIP4, PMIP4, or CMIP6),
#	you have to set WiMAX-IP-Technology in the reply to one of
#	the appropriate values.
#
#
#	FA-RK = H(MIP-RK, "FA-RK")
#
#	MN-FA = H(FA-RK, "MN FA" | FA-IP | MN-NAI)
#
#		Where does the FA-IP come from?  No idea...
#
#
#	The next two keys (HA-RK and FA-HA) are not generated
#	for every authentication request, but only on demand.
#
#	HA-RK = 160-bit random number assigned by the AAA server
#		to a specific HA.
#
#	FA-HA = H(HA-RK, "FA-HA" | HA-IPv4 | FA-CoAv4 | SPI)
#
#		where HA-IPv4 is as above.
#		and FA-CoAv4 address of the FA as seen by the HA
#		and SPI is the relevant SPI for the HA-RK.
#
#	DHCP-RK = 160-bit random number assigned by the AAA server
#		  to a specific DHCP server.  vDHCP-RK is the same
#		  thing.

	#  By default, the EAP modules sends MS-MPPE-*-Key attributes.

	#  This configuration option makes the WiMAX module delete

	#
	#  If the keys are deleted (by setting this to "yes"), then

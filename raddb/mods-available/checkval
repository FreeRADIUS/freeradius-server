#  A simple value checking module
#
#  As of 2.0, much of the functionality of this module is in "unlang".
#  You should probably investigate using that before trying to use
#  the "checkval" module.
#
#  It can be used to check if an attribute value in the request
#  matches a (possibly multi valued) attribute in the check
#  items This can be used for example for caller-id
#  authentication.  For the module to run, both the request
#  attribute and the check items attribute must exist
#
#  i.e.
#  A user has an ldap entry with 2 radiusCallingStationId
#  attributes with values "12345678" and "12345679".  If we
#  enable rlm_checkval, then any request which contains a
#  Calling-Station-Id with one of those two values will be
#  accepted.  Requests with other values for
#  Calling-Station-Id will be rejected.
#
#  Regular expressions in the check attribute value are allowed
#  as long as the operator is '=~'
#
checkval {
	# The attribute to look for in the request
	item-name = Calling-Station-Id

	# The attribute to look for in check items. Can be multi valued
	check-name = Calling-Station-Id

	# The data type. Can be
	# string,integer,ipaddr,date,abinary,octets
	data-type = string

	# If set to yes and we dont find the item-name attribute in the
	# request then we send back a reject
	# DEFAULT is no
	#notfound-reject = no
}

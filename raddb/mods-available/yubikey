#
#  This module decrypts and validates Yubikey static and dynamic
#  OTP tokens.
#
yubikey {
	#
	#  The length (number of ASCII bytes) of the Public-ID portion
	#  of the OTP string.
	#
	#  Yubikey defaults to a 6 byte ID (2 * 6 = 12)
#	id_length = 12

	#
	#  If true, the authorize method of rlm_yubikey will attempt to split the
	#  value of User-Password, into the user's password, and the OTP token.
	#
	#  If enabled and successful, the value of &request:User-Password will be
	#  truncated and &request:Yubikey-OTP will be added.
	#
#	split = yes

	#
	#  Decrypt mode - Tokens will be decrypted and processed locally
	#
	#  The module itself does not provide persistent storage as this
	#  would be duplicative of functionality already in the server.
	#
	#  Yubikey authentication needs two attributes retrieved from
	#  persistent storage:
	#    * &control:Yubikey-Key        - The AES key used to decrypt the OTP data.
	#                                    The Yubikey-Public-Id and/or User-Name
	#                                    attributes may be used to retrieve the key.
	#    * &control:Yubikey-Counter    - This is compared with the counter in the OTP
	#                                    data and used to prevent replay attacks.
	#                                    This attribute will also be available in
	#                                    the request list after successful
	#                                    decryption.
	#
	#  Yubikey-Counter isn't strictly required, but the server will
	#  generate warnings if it's not present when yubikey.authenticate
	#  is called.
	#
	#  These attributes are available after authorization:
	#    * &request:Yubikey-Public-ID  - The public portion of the OTP string.
	#  and additionally if 'split' is set:
	#    * &request:Yubikey-OTP        - The OTP portion of User-Password.
	#
	#  These attributes are available after authentication (if successful):
	#    * &request:Yubikey-Private-ID - The encrypted ID included in OTP data,
	#                                    must be verified if tokens share keys.
	#    * &request:Yubikey-Counter    - The last counter value (should be recorded).
	#    * &request:Yubikey-Timestamp  - Token's internal clock (mainly useful for
	#                                    debugging).
	#    * &request:Yubikey-Random     - Randomly generated value from the token.
	#
	decrypt = no

			#  Maximum number of connections

			#  If these connections are all in use and a new one

			#
			#  Setting 'max' to LESS than the number of threads means
			#  that some threads may starve, and you will see errors

			#  NOTE: All configuration settings are enforced.  If a
			#  connection is closed because of "idle_timeout",
			#  "uses", or "lifetime", then the total number of
			#  connections MAY fall below "min".  When that
			#  happens, it will open a new connection.  It will
			#  also log a WARNING message.
			#
			#  The solution is to either lower the "min" connections,
			#  or increase lifetime/idle_timeout.

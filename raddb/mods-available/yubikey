#
#  This module decrypts and validates Yubikey static and dynamic
#  OTP tokens.
#
yubikey {
	#
	#  The length (number of ASCII bytes) of the Public-ID portion
	#  of the OTP string.
	#
	#  Yubikey defaults to a 6 byte ID (2 * 6 = 12)
#	id_length = 12

	#
	#  If true, the authorize method of rlm_yubikey will attempt to split the
	#  value of User-Password, into the user's password, and the OTP token.
	#
	#  If enabled and successful, the value of &request:User-Password will be
	#  truncated and &request:Yubikey-OTP will be added.
	#
#	split = yes

	#
	#  Decrypt mode - Tokens will be decrypted and processed locally
	#
	#  In the authorize section, this module should be placed before the
	#  persistent storage module.
	#
	#  The authenticate section should have the following added:
	#	 Auth-Type yubikey {
	#	#	pap
	#		yubikey
	#	 }
	#
	#  If two factor authentication (password concatenated with OTP) is
	#  required, split configuration should be set to yes and the pap module
	#  should be uncommented. Each account will need a password added (either
	#  using attribute Cleartext-Password, SSHA-Password, etc.).
	#
	#  The module itself does not provide persistent storage as this
	#  would be duplicative of functionality already in the server.
	#
	#  Yubikey authentication needs two attributes retrieved from 
	#  persistent storage:
	#    * &control:Yubikey-Key        - The AES key used to decrypt the OTP data.
	#                                    The Yubikey-Public-Id and/or User-Name
	#                                    attributes may be used to retrieve the key.
	#    * &control:Yubikey-Counter    - This is compared with the counter in the OTP
	#                                    data and used to prevent replay attacks.
	#                                    This attribute will also be available in
	#                                    the request list after successful
	#                                    decryption.
	#
	#  Yubikey-Counter isn't strictly required, but the server will
	#  generate warnings if it's not present when yubikey.authenticate
	#  is called.
	#
	#  These attributes are available after authorization:
	#    * &request:Yubikey-Public-ID  - The public portion of the OTP string.
	#  and additionally if 'split' is set:
	#    * &request:Yubikey-OTP        - The OTP portion of User-Password.
	#
	#  These attributes are available after authentication (if successful):
	#    * &request:Yubikey-Private-ID - The encrypted ID included in OTP data,
	#                                    must be verified if tokens share keys.
	#    * &request:Yubikey-Counter    - The last counter value (should be recorded).
	#    * &request:Yubikey-Timestamp  - Token's internal clock (mainly useful for
	#                                    debugging).
	#    * &request:Yubikey-Random     - Randomly generated value from the token.
	#

			# NOTE: All configuration settings are enforced.  If a
			# connection is closed because of "idle_timeout",
			# "uses", or "lifetime", then the total number of
			# connections MAY fall below "min".  When that
			# happens, it will open a new connection.  It will
			# also log a WARNING message.
			#
			# The solution is to either lower the "min" connections,
			# or increase lifetime/idle_timeout.

			# Enable LRU (Least Recently Used)
			#
			# The yubico library uses curl multihandles. If the
			# multihandle is reused before all requests are completed
			# the connections are re-established.
			#
			# The cost of re-establishing the connections is greater
			# than the benefit of maintaining a small pool of
			# connections or optimising for link latency.

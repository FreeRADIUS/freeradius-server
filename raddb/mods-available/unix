#  This module calls the system functions to get the "known good"
#  password.  This password is usually in the "crypt" form, and is
#  incompatible with CHAP, MS-CHAP, PEAP, etc.
#
#  If passwords are in /etc/shadow, you will need to set the "group"
#  configuration in radiusd.conf.  Look for "shadow", and follow the
#  instructions there.

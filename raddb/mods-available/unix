#  = Unix Module
#
#  The `unix` module calls the system `getpwnam()` functions to get
#  the `known good` password for the `User-Name`.
#
#  If the passwords are in /etc/shadow, you will need to set the
#  `group` configuration in `radiusd.conf` so that the server can read
#  /etc/shadow.
#
#  Look for "shadow", and follow the instructions there.
#
#  NOTE: This password is usually in the `crypt` form, and is incompatible
#  with `CHAP`, `MS-CHAP`, `PEAP`, etc*.
#
#  == Group Comparisons
#
#  The module also registers a Unix group expansion, where it is possible
#  to check if the user is a member of a particular Unix group.
#
#    if (%unix.group(admin)) { ...
#
#  The expansion returns `true` if the `User-Name` is a membber of the given
#  group, and `false` otherwise.
#
#  The old `Unix-Group`, `Group`, and `Group-Name` attributes and comparisons
#  are no longer supported.
#
#  All of `radutmp`, `radwho`, `radlast`, and `radzap` have been removed.
#
#  You can no longer have the `unix` module process accounting packets.
#

# Unix /etc/passwd style authentication
#
#  This module calls the system functions to get the "known good"
#  password.  This password is usually in the "crypt" form, and is
#  incompatible with CHAP, MS-CHAP, PEAP, etc.
#
#  If passwords are in /etc/shadow, you will need to set the "group"
#  configuration in radiusd.conf.  Look for "shadow", and follow the
#  instructions there.

	#  'radlast', then you can comment out this item.

	#  Note that the radwtmp file may get large!  You should
	#  rotate it (cp /dev/null radwtmp), or just not use it.
	#
	#  wtmp files are gradually becoming obsolete. Some systems
	#  may not have 'last' or 'radlast' available any more.
	#  You shoud use a database instead.

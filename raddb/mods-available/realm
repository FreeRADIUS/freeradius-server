# Realm module, for proxying.

#  You can have multiple instances of the realm module to
#  support multiple realm syntaxes at the same time.  The
#  search order is defined by the order that the modules are listed
#  in the authorize and preacct sections.
#
#  Four config options:
#	format	 -  must be "prefix" or "suffix"
#			  The special cases of "DEFAULT"
#			  and "NULL" are allowed, too.
#	delimiter      -  must be a single character

#  'realm/username'
#
#  Using this entry, IPASS users have their realm set to "IPASS".

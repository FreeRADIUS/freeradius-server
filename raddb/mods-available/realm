# Realm module, for proxying.
#
#  You can have multiple instances of the realm module to
#  support multiple realm syntaxes at the same time.  The
#  search order is defined by the order that the modules are listed
#  in the authorize and preacct sections.
#
#  Four config options:
#	format	 -  must be "prefix" or "suffix"
#			  The special cases of "DEFAULT"
#			  and "NULL" are allowed, too.
#	delimiter      -  must be a single character

#
#  For dynamic home servers, see doc/configuration/dynamic_home_servers.md,
#  and the script in mods-config/realm/freeradius-naptr-to-home-server.sh
#

#  'realm/username'
#
#  Using this entry, IPASS users have their realm set to "IPASS".
realm IPASS {
	format = prefix
	delimiter = "/"
}

#  'username@realm'
#
realm suffix {
	format = suffix
	delimiter = "@"

	# The next configuration items are valid ONLY for a trust-router.
	# For all other realms, they are ignored.
#	trust_router = "localhost"
#	tr_port = 12309
#	rp_realm = "realm.example.com"
#	default_community = "apc.communities.example.com"
#	# if rekey_enabled is enabled, dynamic realms are automatically rekeyed
#	# before they expire to avoid having to recreate them from scrach on
#	# demand (implying lengthy authentications)
#	rekey_enabled = no
#	# if realm_lifetime is > 0, the rekey is scheduled to happen the
#	# specified number of seconds after its creation or rekeying. Otherwise,
#	# the key material expiration timestamp is used
#	realm_lifetime = 0

	#
	#  Prior to 3.2.9, the module would return "noop" when a realm was not found.
	#  This can be changed to return "notfound" by setting the flag below.
	#
	#  This change allows unlang policies to distinguish a "noop"
	#  case from "notfound".
	#
	#  "noop" is "module cannot do anything".  Which means there is no User-Name,
	#  or the User-Name does not contain the delimiter, etc.
	#
	#  "notfound" means that the User-Name is found, it contains the expected delimiter,
	#  but the destination realm was not found.
	#
	return_notfound = no

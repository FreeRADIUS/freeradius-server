# Realm module, for proxying.
#
#  You can have multiple instances of the realm module to
#  support multiple realm syntaxes at the same time.  The
#  search order is defined by the order that the modules are listed
#  in the authorize and preacct sections.
#
#  Four config options:
#	format	 -  must be "prefix" or "suffix"
#			  The special cases of "DEFAULT"
#			  and "NULL" are allowed, too.
#	delimiter      -  must be a single character

#  'realm/username'
#
#  Using this entry, IPASS users have their realm set to "IPASS".

	format = prefix
	delimiter = "/"

#	tr_port = 12309
#	rp_realm = "realm.example.com"
#	default_community = "apc.communities.example.com"

#	# before they expire to avoid having to recreate them from scrach on
#	# demand (implying lengthy authentications)
#	rekey_enabled = no
#	# if realm_lifetime is > 0, the rekey is scheduled to happen the
#	# specified number of seconds after its creation or rekeying. Otherwise,
#	# the key material expiration timestamp is used

#  = IDN Module
#
#  The `idn` (Internationalised domain names) encoding for DNS aka IDNA
#  standardized in RFC 3490.
#
#  [NOTE]
#  ====
#  The expansion string: `%{idn:example.com}` results in an ASCII
#  punycode version of the domain name.  That version can then be used
#  for name comparisons.  Using an `i18n` version of the name is *NOT
#  RECOMMENDED*, as that version is not canonical.
#
#  i.e. the `same` domain name can be represented in many, many,
#  different ways.  Only the `idn` version has *one* representation.
#  ====
#

#  ## Configuration Settings

	#  allow_unassigned::

	#
	#  use_std3_ascii_rules::
	#
	#  Prohibit underscores and other invalid characters in domain names.

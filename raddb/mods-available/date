#  = Date Module
#
#  The `date` module parses dates, and prints them.
#
#  The server will normally print dates in its own pre-defined format.
#  It will also parse dates in a few limited formats.  However, these
#  operations are for full dates (e.g. January 1, 2020 12:34pm).  The
#  server does not print dates in other formats, and does not parse
#  dates in other formats.
#
#  The `date` module adds that functionality.  It allows you to print
#  dates in almost any format you want.  It allows you to parse dates
#  in almost any format, so long as you know what the fields are, and
#  how they are defined.
#

#
#  == Configuration Settings
#
date {
	#
	#  format:: Formatting of the output string.
	#
	#  The format arguments are the same as for the system
	#  `strftime` call.  See `man strftime` for documentation.
	#
	format = "%b %e %Y %H:%M:%S %Z"

	#
	#  utc:: Whether conversions are in UTC or local time.
	#
	#  If `utc` is enabled then any conversions will be made
	#  as UTC, not localtime.
	#
	#  .Default is to use localtime.
	#
#	utc = no
}

#
#  === ISO format
#
#  The core `xlat`, `%T` returns the request timestamp in `ISO` format
#  including milliseconds. This expansion returns it without the
#  millisecond component.
#
#  Use e.g. `%date_iso(request):`
#
date date_iso {
	format = "%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ"
	utc = yes
}

#
#  === xlat expansions
#
#  The `date` module defines an expansion `%date()` When the
#  expansion is not passed an argument, it returns the current date
#  printed according to the `format` string defined above.
#
#  ."Attribute" mode:
#
#  If the argument to `%date(...)` is an attribute of `date` or
#  `integer` type, the date used will be the time given by the
#  relevant attribute.   If the attributes is of type `string`, the
#  string will be parsed according to the `format` configuration,
#  and a Unix date will be returned, as integer seconds since the epoch.
#
#  For example, `%date('Event-Timestamp')` will use the date from the
#  `Event-Timestamp` attribute as the source of the date for printing.
#
#  ."Get time" mode:
#
#  If the input is the string `request`, the `xlat` will format the
#  time the current request packet arrived according to the format
#  string, and return it as a string.
#
#  If the input is the string `now`, the `xlat` will behave as
#  above, for the current time.
#
#  If the input string begins with `+`, then the remainder of the
#  string is interpreted as if the string had been given in the
#  `format` configuration item.
#
#  For example `%date('+%A')` will return `Monday` if today is Monday.
#
#  Note that the `%` character is special for xlat expansions, and therefore
#  either has to be "protected" by string quotation, or the `%` character has
#  to be escaped itself, as in `%date(+%%A)`
#
#  ."Integer output"
#
#  In some cases, it is useful for the module to parse dates instead
#  of printing them.  In this mode, the format string is ignored.
#  Instead, the input arguments are parsed, and the output is an
#  integer containing the requested value.
#
#  The following expansions return integer numbers:
#
#  [options="header,autowidth"]
#  |===
#  | Parameter        | Description
#  | %l               | request time in seconds since the epoch.
#  | %M               | request time microsecond component.
#  | %c               | current time in seconds since the epoch.
#  | %C               | current time microsecond component.
#  | 'Attribute-Name' | for string attributes, parse the string according to `format`, and return the integer value as a Unix timestamp.
#  |===

#  = Redis IP Pool Module
#
#  The `redis_ippool` module implements a fast and scalable IP
#  allocation system using Redis.
#
#  The module supports both IPv4 and IPv6 address and prefix
#  allocation, and implements pre-allocation for use with DHCPv4.
#
#  Lease allocation throughput scales with the number of members in
#  the Redis cluster.
#

#
#  ## Configuration Settings
#
#  Al configuration items at this level (below the `redis` block)
#  are polymorphic, meaning `xlats`, attribute references, literal values
#  and execs may be specified.
#
#  For example `pool_nam` could be `pool_name = 'my_test_pool'` if only a
#  single pool were being used.
#
redis_ippool {
	#
	#  pool_name:: Name of the pool from which leases are allocated.
	#
	pool_name = &control:Pool-Name

	#
	#  offer_time:: How long a lease is reserved for after making an offer.
	#
	#  If no value is provided, the value from lease_time is used
	#  for initial allocations.
	#
	#  NOTE: No value should be provided for _PPP/VPNs_, this is mainly for the
	#  _DORA_ flow in _DHCP_.
	#
	offer_time = 30

	#
	#  lease_time:: How long a lease is allocated.
	#
	lease_time = 3600

	#
	#  wait_num:: How many slaves we want to acknowledge allocations or updates.
	#
#	wait_num = 10

	#
	#  wait_timeout:: How long we wait for slaves to acknowledge writing.
	#
#	wait_timeout = 2

	#
	#  gateway:: Gateway identifier, usually `NAS-Identifier` or the actual Option 82 gateway.
	#  Used for bulk lease cleanups.
	#
#	gateway = &NAS-Identifier

	#
	#  device:: The unique device identifier to which an IP is assigned.
	#
	#  This is used as the lookup key to determine the IP address that has
	#  been allocated to a device. It MUST therefore be something unique to
	#  each "device" to which an IP address may be assigned.
	#
	#  For DHCP it is often simply the MAC address of the device.
	#
	device = &DHCP-Client-Hardware-Address

	#
	#  RFC 2132 specifies that the DHCP client may supply a unique
	#  identifier ("uid") using Option 61 (DHCP-Client-Identifier) in which
	#  case it must be used as the lookup key for configuration data.
	#  Otherwise the client hardware address must be used. To comply with
	#  this requirement use the following:
	#
#	device = "%{%{DHCP-Client-Identifier}:-%{DHCP-Client-Hardware-Address}}"

	#
	#  For purposes such as IP assignment using a RADIUS Framed-IP-Address
	#  attribute the "device" identifier could be a `User-Name` or a
	#  certificate serial number provided that the number of sessions is
	#  limited to one per user/serial.
	#
	#  On a hostile network it SHOULD include a component that you trust,
	#  arranged such that the overall key cannot be spoofed by manipulation
	#  of the user-controlled data. For example you might determine that
	#  ADSL-Agent-Circuit-Id is trusted but that Calling-Station-Id is
	#  formatted as a user-controlled MAC address:
	#
#	device = "%{ADSL-Agent-Circuit-Id} %{Calling-Station-Id}"

	#
	#  requested_address:: The IP address being renewed or released.
	#
	requested_address = "%{%{DHCP-Requested-IP-Address}:-%{DHCP-Client-IP-Address}}"

	#
	#  ipv4_integer:: Whether IPv4 addresses should be cast to integers, for renew operations.
	#
	#
#	ipv4_integer = yes

	#
	#  allocated_address_attr:: List and attribute where the allocated address is written to.
	#
	allocated_address_attr = &reply:DHCP-Your-IP-Address

	#
	#  range_attr:: List and attribute where the `Pool-Range` ID (if set) is written to.
	#
	#  The idea of the `Pool-Range` is that it provides a key into other datastores
	#  or caches, which store the additional options associated with the range an
	#  IP address belongs to.
	#
	#  There may be multiple ranges of IP address contained within any given pool,
	#  which is why this is provided in addition to the pool name.
	#
	range_attr = &reply:Pool-Range

	#
	#  expiry_attr:: If set - the list and attribute to write the remaining lease time to.
	#
	#  This attribute can be populated on alloc, or renew, if an
	#  IP address was available for the alloc.
	#
	expiry_attr = &reply:DHCP-IP-Address-Lease-Time

	#
	#  copy_on_update:: If true - Copy the value of ip_address to the attribute specified by
	#  `allocated_address_attr` when performing an update/renew.
	#
	#  This behavior is needed for DHCP where we need to send back
	#  `DHCP-Your-IP-Address` in ACKs.
	#
	copy_on_update = yes

	#
	#  redis { ... }:: Redis connection settings.
	#
	#  Identical to all other Redis based modules.
	#
	#  NOTE: See the `redis` module for more information.
	#

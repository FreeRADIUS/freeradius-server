#  WARNING: On some systems, the system PAM libraries have
#  memory leaks!  We STRONGLY SUGGEST that you do not
#  use `PAM` for authentication, due to those memory leaks.

#
#  ## Configuration Settings
#
pam {
	#
	#  pam_auth::
	#
	#  The name to use for PAM authentication.
	#
	#  `PAM` looks in `/etc/pam.d/${pam_auth_name}` for it's
	#  configuration.
	#
	#  See `redhat/radiusd-pam` for a sample PAM configuration file.
	#
	#  NOTE: Any `Pam-Auth` attribute that is set will override
	#  this one.

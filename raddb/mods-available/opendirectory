#  This module is only used when the server is running on the same
#  system as OpenDirectory.  The configuration of the module is hard-coded
#  by Apple, and cannot be changed here.
#
#  There are no configuration entries for this module.
#
#  The MS-CHAP module will automatically talk to OpenDirectory, if the
#  server is built on an OSX machine.  However, you must also set
#  dsAttrTypeNative:apple-enabled-auth-mech attribute in the
#  /config/dirserv OpenDirectory record.  You will probably also need
#  to change the user passwords in order to re-generate the
#  appropriate hashes.

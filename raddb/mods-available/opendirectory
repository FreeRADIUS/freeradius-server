#  = OpenDirectory Module
#
#  The `opendirectory` module is only used when the server is running on the same
#  system as OpenDirectory.  The configuration of the module is hard-coded
#  by Apple, and cannot be changed here.
#
#  The `mschap` module will also automatically talk to OpenDirectory
#  if the server is built on an OSX machine.  However, you must also
#  set `dsAttrTypeNative:apple-enabled-auth-mech` attribute in the
#  `/config/dirserv` OpenDirectory record.
#
#  NOTE: You will probably also need to change the user passwords in
#  order to re-generate the appropriate hashes.
#
#  See also https://discussions.apple.com/thread/6053980?tstart=0
#
#  In order to allow NTLM passwords, you may need to run the following
#  command on the OpenDirectory machine:
#
#	dscl -u diradmin -p /LDAPv3/127.0.0.1 -append /Config/dirserv apple-enabled-auth-mech SMB-NTLM2v
#

#
#  ## Configuration Settings
#
#  This module takes no configuration.
#

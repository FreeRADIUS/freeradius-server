#  = WinModule
#
#  The `winbind` module authenticate PAP passwords against Microsoft Active
#  Directory or Samba, via the winbind API.
#
#  This module is for PAP authentication (where plaintext passwords
#  are sent in the `User-Password` attribute) only. For authenticating
#  `mschap` requests against AD/Samba see the options available in the
#  `rlm_mschap` module.
#
#  NOTE: Samba version 4.2.1 or higher is required to use this module.
#

#
#  ## Configuration Settings
#
winbind {
	#
	#  username:: The username to pass to `winbind` for authentication.
	#
	username = "%{%{Stripped-User-Name}:-%{User-Name}}"

	#
	#  domain:: The windows domain.
	#
	#  While not required to be set, it is likely authentication will fail
	#  if it is not set correctly.
	#
	#  This configuration option, as the username above, is also expanded before use.
	#
	#  If unset then winbind will be queried for the correct value. If you
	#  actually want it blank it should be explicitly set here.
	#
#	domain = ""

	#
	#  group { ... }:: Group membership checking.
	#
	group {
		#
		#  search_username:: AD username to search for group searches.
		#
		#  This should generally not include a realm, so `Stripped-User-Name`
		#  is likely the best attribute if it exists.
		#
		search_username = "%{%{Stripped-User-Name}:-%{User-Name}}"

		#
		#  add_domain:: Include the domain in group searches.
		#
		#  When this is enabled, winbind_domain is prepended to the
		#  username (as `domain\username`) before searching. This is
		#  generally required.
		#
#		add_domain = yes

		#
		#  attribute:: Attribute to use for group comparisons.
		#
		#  This will normally be `Winbind-Group` if this instance is
		#  unnamed, otherwise it will be `name-Winbind-Group`. The
		#  name of this attribute can be overridden here.
		#
#		attribute = "Winbind-Group"
	}

	#
	#  pool { ... }::
	#
	#  Information for the `winbind` connection pool.
	#
	#  The configuration items below are the same for all modules which
	#  use the new connection pool.
	#
	pool {
		#
		#  start::
		#
		#  Connections to create during module instantiation.
		#  If the server cannot create specified number of
		#  connections during instantiation it will exit.
		#
		#  Set to `0` to allow the server to start without the
		#  winbind daemon being available.
		#
		start = ${thread[pool].num_workers}

		#
		#  min:: Minimum number of connections to keep open.
		#
		min = ${thread[pool].num_workers}

		#
		#  max:: Maximum number of connections.
		#
		#  If these connections are all in use and a new one
		#  is requested, the request will NOT get a connection.
		#
		#  Setting `max` to LESS than the number of threads means
		#  that some threads may starve, and you will see errors
		#  like 'No connections available and at max connection limit'
		#
		#  Setting `max` to MORE than the number of threads means
		#  that there are more connections than necessary.
		#
		max = ${thread[pool].num_workers}

		#
		#  spare:: Spare connections to be left idle.
		#
		#  NOTE: Idle connections WILL be closed if `idle_timeout`
		#  is set. This should be less than or equal to `max` above.
		#
		spare = 1

		#
		#  uses:: Number of uses before the connection is closed.
		#
		#  NOTE: A setting of 0 means infinite (no limit).
		#
		uses = 0

		#
		#  retry_delay:: The number of seconds to wait after the server tries
		#  to open a connection, and fails.
		#
		#  During this time, no new connections will be opened.
		#
		retry_delay = 30

		#
		#  lifetime:: The lifetime (in seconds) of the connection.
		#
		#  NOTE: A setting of 0 means infinite (no limit).
		#
		lifetime = 86400

		#
		#  cleanup_interval:: The pool is checked for free connections every
		#  `cleanup_interval`.
		#
		#  If there are free connections, then one of them is closed.
		#
		cleanup_interval = 300

		#
		#  idle_timeout:: The idle timeout (in seconds).
		#
		#  A connection which is unused for this length of time will be closed.
		#
		#  NOTE: A setting of 0 means infinite (no timeout).
		#
		idle_timeout = 600

		#
		#  [NOTE]
		#  ====
		#  All configuration settings are enforced.  If a connection is closed because of
		#  `idle_timeout`, `uses`, or `lifetime`, then the total
		#  number of connections MAY fall below `min`.
		#
		#  When that happens, it will open a new connection. It will also log a *WARNING* message.
		#
		#  The solution is to either lower the "min" connections, or
		#  increase lifetime/idle_timeout.

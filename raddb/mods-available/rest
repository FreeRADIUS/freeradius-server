	#  The following config items may be listed in any of the sections:
	#    uri          - to send the request to.
	#    method       - HTTP method to use, one of 'get', 'post', 'put', 'patch',
	#                   'delete' or any custom HTTP method.
	#    body         - The format of the HTTP body sent to the remote server.
	#                   May be 'none', 'post' or 'json', defaults to 'none'.
	#    data         - Send custom freeform data in the HTTP body. Content-type
	#                   may be specified with 'body'. Will be expanded.
	#                   Values from expansion will not be escaped, this should be
	#                   done using the appropriate xlat method e.g. %{urlencode:<attr>}.
	#    force_to     - Force the response to be decoded with this decoder.
	#                   May be 'plain' (creates reply:REST-HTTP-Body), 'post'
	#                   or 'json'.
	#    tls          - TLS settings for HTTPS.
	#    auth         - HTTP auth method to use, one of 'none', 'srp', 'basic',
	#                   'digest', 'digest-ie', 'gss-negotiate', 'ntlm',
	#                   'ntlm-winbind', 'any', 'safe'. defaults to 'none'.
	#    username     - User to authenticate as, will be expanded.
	#    password     - Password to use for authentication, will be expanded.
	#    require_auth - Require HTTP authentication.
	#    timeout      - HTTP request timeout in seconds, defaults to 4.0.
	#
	#  Additional HTTP headers may be specified with control:REST-HTTP-Header.
	#  The values of those attributes should be in the format:

	#               in string form. Defaults to true.
	#  - op	        Controls how the attribute is inserted into the target list.

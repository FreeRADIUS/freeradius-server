#  = Rest Module
#
#  The `rest` module sends HTTP requests to remote servers and decodes
#  the responses. Can also perform basic auth with user's credentials.
#
#  See RFC 2616 for more details about HTTP.
#

rest {
	#
	#  tls { ... }:: Configure the tls related items that control
	#  how FreeRADIUS connects to a HTTPS server.
	#
	tls {

		#  .Certificate validation options
		#
		#  Specifies how the certificate(s) presented by the HTTPS server being contacted
		#  are validated, and which certificates (if any) to send to the HTTPS server.
		#

		#
		#  ca_file:: PEM formatted file containing the chain to validate the HTTPS server's cert
		#
		#  Should usually contain a concatenation of one or more intermediary CA
		#  files, shallowest (i.e. the one that signed the HTTPS server's cert) first, and
		#  deepest (the root CA) last.
		#
		#  Providing a complete certificate chain here is the most common way of validating
		#  the certificate presented by a HTTPS server.
		#
#		ca_file	             = "${certdir}/cacert.pem"

		#
		#  ca_issuer_file:: PEM formatted file containing the CA that signed the HTTPS server's cert
		#
		#  Specifies the certificate that directly signed the certificate presented by the
		#  HTTPS server.
		#
		#  This configuration option can be used to prevent certificates passing validation that
		#  were signed by other intermediary CAs or root CAs in the trusted certificate chain.
		#
#		ca_issuer_file     = "${certdir}/caissuer.pem"

		#
		#  ca_path:: A directory containing multiple root CA certs named by their hash

		#  - https://www.openssl.org/docs/man1.1.1/man1/c_rehash.html
		#
		#  This configuration option should only be used when the HTTPS server being contacted
		#  is not known ahead of time (using a URL from an external source), and/or the CA used
		#  to sign the HTTPS server certificate is unknown.
		#
#		ca_path	             = "${certdir}"

		#
		#  certificate_file:: PEM formatted file containing the certificate we present to the HTTPS server
		#
		#  Specifies a certificate and any intermediary CAs we should send to the HTTPS server.
		#
		#  This file should usually contain the client certificate file first, then any
		#  intermediary signing CAs, shallowest (direct signee of the certificate_file)
		#  to deepest (signed directly by the root CA).
		#
#		certificate_file     = /path/to/radius.pem

		#
		#  check_cert_cn:: Server certificate CN verification requirements.
		#
		#  May be one of:
		#
		#  [options="header,autowidth"]
		#  |===
		#  | Option | Description
		#  | `no`   | Server certificate CN can be any value.

	#  connect_uri:: It will open a connection to the server specified in `connect_uri`
	#  to populate the connection cache, ready for the first request.
	#
	#  If you wish to disable this pre-caching and reachability check,

	#
	#  multiplex:: Execute multiple requests simultaneously using the same HTTP connection.

	#
	#  ## Sections
	#
	#  The following config items can be used in each of the sections.
	#  The sections themselves reflect the sections in the server.
	#
	#  For example, if you list `rest` in the `authorize` section of a `virtual server`,
	#  the settings from the `authorize` section here will be used.
	#
	#  The following config items may be listed in any of the sections:
	#
	#  [options="header,autowidth"]
	#  |===
	#  | Option         | Description
	#  | `uri`          | To send the request to.
	#  | `proxy`        | Rhe request via this server, supports `socks/http/https` uri and `:port`.
	#  | `method`       | HTTP method to use, one of 'get', 'post', 'put', 'patch',
	#                     'delete' or any custom HTTP method.
	#  | `body`         | The format of the HTTP body sent to the remote server.
	#                     May be 'none', 'post' or 'json', defaults to 'none'.
	#  | `data`         | Send custom freeform data in the HTTP body. `Content-type`
	#                     may be specified with `body`. Will be expanded.
	#                     Values from expansion will not be escaped, this should be
	#                     done using the appropriate `xlat` method e.g. `%{urlencode:<attr>}`
	#  | `force_to`     | Force the response to be decoded with this decoder.
	#                     May be 'plain' (creates reply:REST-HTTP-Body), 'post' or 'json'.
	#  | `tls`          | TLS settings for HTTPS.
	#  | `auth`         | HTTP auth method to use, one of 'none', 'srp', 'basic',
	#                     'digest', 'digest-ie', 'gss-negotiate', 'ntlm',

	#  | `timeout`      | HTTP request timeout in seconds, defaults to 4.0.
	#  | `max_body_in`  | Maximum size of incoming HTTP body, defaults to 16k.
	#  |===
	#
	#  Additional HTTP headers may be specified with `control:REST-HTTP-Header`.
	#
	#  The values of those attributes should be in the format:
	#
	#    <attribute>: <value>
	#
	#  `control:REST-HTTP-Header` attributes will be consumed after each call
	#  to the rest module, and each `%{rest:}` expansion.
	#

	#
	#  .Body encodings are the same for requests and responses
	#
	#  POST - All attributes and values are urlencoded.
	#
	#  e.g:
	#
	#  `[outer.][<list>:]<attribute0>=<value0>&[outer.][<list>:]<attributeN>=<valueN>`
	#
	#  JSON - All attributes and values are escaped according to the JSON specification.
	#
	#  e.g:
	#
	#  [source,json]
	#  ----
	#  {
	#      "<attribute0>":{
	#          "type":"<type0>",
	#          "value":[<value0>,<value1>,<valueN>]
	#      },
	#      "<attribute1>":{

	#      "<attributeN>":{
	#          "type":"<typeN>",
	#          "value":[...]
	#      },
	#  }
	#  ----
	#
	#  The response format adds three optional fields:
	#
	#  [options="header,autowidth"]
	#  |===
	#  | Fields    | Description
	#  | `do_xlat` | If `true`, any values will be xlat expanded. Defaults to `true`.
	#  | `is_json` | If `true`, any nested JSON data will be copied to the attribute
	#                in string form. Defaults to `true`.
	#  | `op`      | Controls how the attribute is inserted into the target list.
	#                Defaults to `:=`. To create multiple attributes from multiple
	#                values, this should be set to `+=`, otherwise only the last
	#                value will be used, and it will be assigned to a single
	#                attribute.
	#  |===
	#
	#  [source,json]
	#  ----
	#  {

	#  * Module return codes are determined by HTTP response codes. These vary depending on the

	#  * With HTTP >= 2.0 with multiplexing enabled, multiple requests are

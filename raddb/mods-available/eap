#
#  Whatever you do, do NOT set 'Auth-Type := EAP'.  The server
#  is smart enough to figure this out on its own.  The most
#  common side effect of setting 'Auth-Type := EAP' is that the
#  users then cannot use ANY other authentication method.
#
eap {
	#  Invoke the default supported EAP type when
	#  EAP-Identity response is received.
	#
	#  The incoming EAP messages DO NOT specify which EAP
	#  type they will be using, so it MUST be set here.
	#
	#  For now, only one default EAP type may be used at a time.
	#
	#  If the EAP-Type attribute is set by another module,
	#  then that EAP type takes precedence over the
	#  default type configured here.
	#
	default_eap_type = md5

	#  A list is maintained to correlate EAP-Response
	#  packets with EAP-Request packets.  After a
	#  configurable length of time, entries in the list
	#  expire, and are deleted.
	#
	timer_expire = 60

	#
	#  Some supplicants may misbehave by starting many thousands
	#  of EAP sessions, but never finishing them.  These sessions
	#  can cause the server to hit 'max_sessions' very quickly.
	#  The 'timer_expire' configuration above does not help as
	#  much as it could, because the old (duplicate) session
	#  should be deleted as soon as the new one comes in.
	#
	#  If you set the 'dedup_key' below, whenever the EAP module
	#  starts a new session, it will check for a previous session
	#  which has the same dedup key.  If a previous session
	#  is found, it is deleted.
	#
	#  Setting this configuration item may cause issues if the
	#  same device uses multiple EAP sessions at the same time.
	#  But that device behavior should be rare to non-existent.
	#
	#  The configuration item is commented out so that upgrades
	#  do not change existing behavior.

#	dedup_key = "%{Calling-Station-Id}"

	#  There are many EAP types, but the server has support
	#  for only a limited subset.  If the server receives
	#  a request for an EAP type it does not support, then
	#  it normally rejects the request.  By setting this
	#  configuration to "yes", you can tell the server to
	#  instead keep processing the request.  Another module
	#  MUST then be configured to proxy the request to
	#  another RADIUS server which supports that EAP type.
	#
	#  If another module is NOT configured to handle the
	#  request, then the request will still end up being
	#  rejected.

	#  Cisco LEAP
	#
	#  We do not recommend using LEAP in new deployments.  See:
	#  http://www.securiteam.com/tools/5TP012ACKE.html
	#
	#  LEAP is not supported.
	#  It is insecure, and no one should be using it.
	#


	#  EAP-GTC -- Generic Token Card
	#
	#  Currently, this is only permitted inside of EAP-TTLS,
	#  or EAP-PEAP.  The module "challenges" the user with
	#  text, and the response from the user is taken to be
	#  the User-Password.
	#
	#  Proxying the tunneled EAP-GTC session is a bad idea,
	#  the users password will go over the wire in plain-text,
	#  for anyone to see.
	#
	gtc {
		#  The default challenge, which many clients
		#  ignore..
		#
	#	challenge = "Password: "

		#  The plain-text response which comes back
		#  is put into a User-Password attribute,
		#  and passed to another module for
		#  authentication.  This allows the EAP-GTC
		#  response to be checked against plain-text,
		#  or crypt'd passwords.
		#
		#  If you say "Local" instead of "PAP", then
		#  the module will look for a User-Password
		#  configured for the request, and do the
		#  authentication itself.

	#  Common TLS configuration for TLS-based EAP types
	#  ------------------------------------------------
	#
	#  See raddb/certs/README.md for additional comments
	#  on certificates.
	#
	#  If OpenSSL was not found at the time the server was
	#  built, the "tls", "ttls", and "peap" sections will
	#  be ignored.
	#
	#  If you do not currently have certificates signed by
	#  a trusted CA you may use the 'snakeoil' certificates.
	#  Included with the server in raddb/certs.
	#
	#  If these certificates have not been auto-generated:
	#    cd raddb/certs
	#    make
	#
	#  These test certificates SHOULD NOT be used in a normal
	#  deployment.  They are created only to make it easier
	#  to install the server, and to perform some simple
	#  tests with EAP-TLS, TTLS, or PEAP.
	#
	#  Note that you should NOT use a globally known CA here!
	#  e.g. using a Verisign cert as a "known CA" means that
	#  ANYONE who has a certificate signed by them can
	#  authenticate via EAP-TLS!  This is likely not what you want.
	#
	tls-config tls-common {
		private_key_password = whatever
		private_key_file = ${certdir}/server.pem

		#  If Private key & Certificate are located in
		#  the same file, then private_key_file &
		#  certificate_file must contain the same file
		#  name.
		#
		#  If ca_file (below) is not used, then the
		#  certificate_file below SHOULD also include all of
		#  the intermediate CA certificates used to sign the
		#  server certificate, but NOT the root CA.
		#
		#  Including the ROOT CA certificate is not useful and
		#  merely inflates the exchanged data volume during
		#  the TLS negotiation.
		#
		#  This file should contain the server certificate,
		#  followed by intermediate certificates, in order.
		#  i.e. If we have a server certificate signed by CA1,
		#  which is signed by CA2, which is signed by a root
		#  CA, then the "certificate_file" should contain
		#  server.pem, followed by CA1.pem, followed by
		#  CA2.pem.
		#
		#  When using "ca_file" or "ca_path", the
		#  "certificate_file" should contain only
		#  "server.pem".  And then you may (or may not) need
		#  to set "auto_chain", depending on your version of
		#  OpenSSL.
		#
		#  In short, SSL / TLS certificates are complex.
		#  There are many versions of software, each of which
		#  behave slightly differently.  It is impossible to
		#  give advice which will work everywhere.  Instead,
		#  we give general guidelines.
		#
		certificate_file = ${certdir}/server.pem

		#  Trusted Root CA list
		#
		#  This file can contain multiple CA certificates.
		#  ALL of the CA's in this list will be trusted to
		#  issue client certificates for authentication.
		#
		#  In general, you should use self-signed
		#  certificates for 802.1x (EAP) authentication.
		#  In that case, this CA file should contain
		#  *one* CA certificate.
		#
		ca_file = ${cadir}/ca.pem

		#
		#  Directory where multiple CAs are stored.  Both
		#  "ca_file" and "ca_path" can be used at the same time.
		#
		#  Each file in this directory must contain one
		#  certificate, and ONLY one certificate.
		#
		ca_path = ${cadir}

		# OpenSSL does not reload contents of ca_path dir over time.
		# That means that if check_crl is enabled and CRLs are loaded
		# from ca_path dir, at some point CRLs will expire and
		# the server will stop authenticating users.
		#
		# If ca_path_reload_interval is non-zero, it will force OpenSSL
		# to reload all data from ca_path periodically
		#
		# Flush ca_path each hour
	#	ca_path_reload_interval = 3600

	 	#  OpenSSL will automatically create certificate chains,
	 	#  unless we tell it to not do that.  The problem is that
	 	#  it sometimes gets the chains right from a certificate
	 	#  signature view, but wrong from the clients view.
		#
		#  When setting "auto_chain = no", the server certificate
		#  file MUST include the full certificate chain.
		#
	#	auto_chain = yes

		#  If OpenSSL supports TLS-PSK, then we can use a
		#  fixed PSK identity and (hex) password.  These can
		#  be used at the same time as the certificate
		#  configuration, but only for TLS 1.0 through 1.2.
		#
		#  If PSK and certificates are configured at the same
		#  time for TLS 1.3, then the server will warn you,
		#  and will disable TLS 1.3, as it will not work.
		#
		#  The work around is to have two modules (or for
		#  RadSec, two listen sections).  One will have PSK
		#  configured, and the other will have certificates
		#  configured.
		#
	#	psk_identity = "test"
	#	psk_hexphrase = "036363823"

		#  Dynamic queries for the PSK.  If TLS-PSK is used,
		#  and psk_query is set, then you MUST NOT use
		#  psk_identity or psk_hexphrase.
		#
		#  Instead, use a dynamic expansion similar to the one
		#  below.  It keys off of TLS-PSK-Identity.  It should
		#  return a of string no more than 512 hex characters.
		#  That string will be converted to binary, and will
		#  be used as the dynamic PSK hexphrase.
		#
		#  Note that this query is just an example.  You will
		#  need to customize it for your installation.
		#
	#	psk_query = "%{sql:select hex(key) from psk_keys where keyid = '%{TLS-PSK-Identity}'}"

		#  For DH cipher suites to work in OpenSSL < 1.1.0,
		#  you have to run OpenSSL to create the DH file
		#  first:
		#
		#    openssl dhparam -out certs/dh 2048
		#
		#  For OpenSSL >= 1.1.0, just leave this commented
		#  out, and OpenSSL will do the right thing.
		#
	#	dh_file = ${certdir}/dh

		#  If your system doesn't have /dev/urandom,
		#  you will need to create this file, and
		#  periodically change its contents.

		#  For security reasons, FreeRADIUS doesn't
		#  write to files in its configuration
		#  directory.
		#
	#	random_file = /dev/urandom

		#  This can never exceed the size of a RADIUS
		#  packet (4096 bytes), and is preferably half
		#  that, to accommodate other attributes in
		#  RADIUS packet.  On most APs the MAX packet
		#  length is configured between 1500 - 1600
		#  In these cases, fragment size should be

		#  Check the Certificate Revocation List
		#
		#  1) Copy CA certificates and CRLs to same directory.
		#  2) Execute 'c_rehash <CA certs&CRLs Directory>'.

		#  If check_cert_issuer is set, the value will
		#  be checked against the DN of the issuer in
		#  the client certificate.  If the values do not
		#  match, the certificate verification will fail,
		#  rejecting the user.
		#
		#  This check can be done more generally by checking
		#  the value of the TLS-Client-Cert-Issuer attribute.
		#  This check can be done via any mechanism you
		#  choose.
		#
	#	check_cert_issuer = "/C=GB/ST=Berkshire/L=Newbury/O=My Company Ltd"

		#  If check_cert_cn is set, the value will
		#  be xlat'ed and checked against the CN
		#  in the client certificate.  If the values
		#  do not match, the certificate verification
		#  will fail rejecting the user.
		#
		#  This check is done only if the previous
		#  "check_cert_issuer" is not set, or if
		#  the check succeeds.
		#
		#  This check can be done more generally by writing
		#  "unlang" statements to examine the value of the
		#  TLS-Client-Cert-Common-Name attribute.
		#
	#	check_cert_cn = %{User-Name}

		#
		#  This configuration item only applies when there is
		#  an intermediate CA between the "root" CA, and the
		#  client certificate.  If we trust the root CA, then
		#  by definition we also trust ANY intermediate CA
		#  which is signed by that root.  This means ANOTHER
		#  intermediate CA can issue client certificates, and
		#  have them accepted by the EAP module.
		#
		#  The solution is to list ONLY the trusted CAs in the
		#  FreeRADIUS configuration, and then set this
		#  configuration item to "yes".
		#
		#  Then, when the server receives a client certificate
		#  from an untrusted CA, that authentication request
		#  can be rejected.
		#
		#  It is possible to do these checks in "unlang", by
		#  checking for unknown names in the
		#  TLS-Cert-Common-Name attribute, but that is
		#  more complex.  So we add a configuration option
		#  which can be set once, and which works for all
		#  possible intermediate CAs, no matter what their
		#  value.
		#
	#	reject_unknown_intermediate_ca = no

		#  Set this option to specify the allowed
		#  TLS cipher suites.  The format is listed

		#  TLS signature algorithms for OpenSSL 1.1.1 and above.
		#  The format and available signature algorithms are listed

		#
		# sigalgs_list = ""

		#  If enabled, OpenSSL will use server cipher list
		#  (possibly defined by cipher_list option above)
		#  for choosing right cipher suite rather than
		#  using client-specified list which is OpenSSl default
		#  behavior.  Setting this to "yes" means that OpenSSL
		#  will choose the servers ciphers, even if they do not
		#  best match what the client sends.
		#
		#  TLS negotiation is usually good, but can be imperfect.
		#  This setting allows administrators to "fine tune" it

		#  You can selectively disable TLS versions for
		#  compatability with old client devices.
		#

		#  Set min / max TLS version.
		#
		#  Generally speaking you should NOT use TLS 1.0 or
		#  TLS 1.1.  They are old, possibly insecure, and
		#  deprecated.  However, it is sometimes necessary to
		#  enable it for compatibility with legact systems.
		#  We recommend replacing those legacy systems, and
		#  using at least TLS 1.2.
		#
		#  Some Debian versions disable older versions of TLS,
		#  and requires the application to manually enable
		#  them.
		#
		#  If you are running such a distribution, you should
		#  set these options, otherwise older clients will not
		#  be able to connect.
		#
		#  Allowed values are "1.0", "1.1", "1.2", and "1.3".
		#
		#  As of 2021, it is STRONGLY RECOMMENDED to set
		#
		#	tls_min_version = "1.2"
		#
		#  Older TLS versions are insecure and deprecated.
		#
		#  In order to enable TLS 1.0 and TLS 1.1, you may
		#  also need to update cipher_list below to:
		#
		#   * OpenSSL >= 3.x
		#
		#	cipher_list = "DEFAULT@SECLEVEL=0"
		#
		#   * OpenSSL < 3.x
		#
		#	cipher_list = "DEFAULT@SECLEVEL=1"
		#
		#  The values must be in quotes.
		#
		#  We also STRONGLY RECOMMEND to set
		#
		#	tls_max_version = "1.2"
		#
		#  While the server will accept "1.3" as a value,
		#  most EAP supplicants WILL NOT DO TLS 1.3 PROPERLY.
		#
		#  i.e. they WILL NOT WORK, SO DO NOT ASK QUESTIONS ON
		#  THE LIST ABOUT WHY IT DOES NOT WORK.
		#
		#  The TLS 1.3 support is here for future
		#  compatibility, as clients get upgraded, and people
		#  don't upgrade their copies of FreeRADIUS.
		#
		#  Also note that we only support TLS 1.3 for EAP-TLS,
		#  TTLS, and PEAP.  It is not supported for EAP-FAST.
		#
		tls_min_version = "1.2"
		tls_max_version = "1.2"

		#  Elliptical cryptography configuration
		#
		#  This configuration should be one of the following:
		#
		#  * a name of the curve to use, e.g. "prime256v1".
		#
		#  * a colon separated list of curve NIDs or names.
		#
		#  * an empty string, in which case OpenSSL will choose
		#    the "best" curve for the situation.
		#
		#  For supported curve names, please run

		#  Session resumption / fast reauthentication
		#  cache.
		#
		#  The cache contains the following information:
		#
		#   session Id - unique identifier, managed by SSL
		#   User-Name  - from the Access-Accept
		#   Stripped-User-Name - from the Access-Request
		#   Cached-Session-Policy - from the Access-Accept
		#
		#  See also the "store" subsection below for
		#  additional attributes which can be cached.
		#
		#  The "Cached-Session-Policy" is the name of a
		#  policy which should be applied to the cached
		#  session.  This policy can be used to assign
		#  VLANs, IP addresses, etc.  It serves as a useful
		#  way to re-apply the policy from the original
		#  Access-Accept to the subsequent Access-Accept
		#  for the cached session.
		#
		#  On session resumption, these attributes are
		#  copied from the cache, and placed into the
		#  reply list.
		#
		#  You probably also want "use_tunneled_reply = yes"
		#  when using fast session resumption.
		#
		#  You can check if a session has been resumed by
		#  looking for the existence of the EAP-Session-Resumed
		#  attribute.  Note that this attribute will *only*
		#  exist in the "post-auth" section.
		#
		#  CAVEATS: The cache is stored and reloaded BEFORE
		#  the "post-auth" section is run.  This limitation
		#  makes caching more difficult than it should be.  In
		#  practice, it means that the first authentication
		#  session must set the reply attributes before the
		#  post-auth section is run.
		#
		#  When the session is resumed, the attributes are

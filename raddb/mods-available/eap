#######################################################################
#
#  Whatever you do, do NOT set 'Auth-Type := EAP'.  The server
#  is smart enough to figure this out on its own.  The most
#  common side effect of setting 'Auth-Type := EAP' is that the
#  users then cannot use ANY other authentication method.
#
#  EAP types NOT listed here may be supported via the "eap2" module.
#  See experimental.conf for documentation.
#
	eap {
		#  Invoke the default supported EAP type when
		#  EAP-Identity response is received.
		#
		#  The incoming EAP messages DO NOT specify which EAP
		#  type they will be using, so it MUST be set here.
		#
		#  For now, only one default EAP type may be used at a time.
		#
		#  If the EAP-Type attribute is set by another module,
		#  then that EAP type takes precedence over the
		#  default type configured here.
		#
		default_eap_type = md5

		#  A list is maintained to correlate EAP-Response
		#  packets with EAP-Request packets.  After a
		#  configurable length of time, entries in the list
		#  expire, and are deleted.
		#
		timer_expire     = 60

		#  There are many EAP types, but the server has support
		#  for only a limited subset.  If the server receives
		#  a request for an EAP type it does not support, then
		#  it normally rejects the request.  By setting this
		#  configuration to "yes", you can tell the server to
		#  instead keep processing the request.  Another module
		#  MUST then be configured to proxy the request to
		#  another RADIUS server which supports that EAP type.
		#
		#  If another module is NOT configured to handle the
		#  request, then the request will still end up being
		#  rejected.

		# Cisco LEAP
		#
		#  We do not recommend using LEAP in new deployments.  See:
		#  http://www.securiteam.com/tools/5TP012ACKE.html
		#
		#  Cisco LEAP uses the MS-CHAP algorithm (but not
		#  the MS-CHAP attributes) to perform it's authentication.
		#
		#  As a result, LEAP *requires* access to the plain-text
		#  User-Password, or the NT-Password attributes.
		#  'System' authentication is impossible with LEAP.
		#
		leap {

		#  Generic Token Card.
		#
		#  Currently, this is only permitted inside of EAP-TTLS,
		#  or EAP-PEAP.  The module "challenges" the user with
		#  text, and the response from the user is taken to be
		#  the User-Password.
		#
		#  Proxying the tunneled EAP-GTC session is a bad idea,
		#  the users password will go over the wire in plain-text,
		#  for anyone to see.
		#
		gtc {
			#  The default challenge, which many clients
			#  ignore..
			#challenge = "Password: "

			#  The plain-text response which comes back
			#  is put into a User-Password attribute,
			#  and passed to another module for
			#  authentication.  This allows the EAP-GTC
			#  response to be checked against plain-text,
			#  or crypt'd passwords.
			#
			#  If you say "Local" instead of "PAP", then
			#  the module will look for a User-Password
			#  configured for the request, and do the
			#  authentication itself.

		## EAP-TLS
		#
		#  See raddb/certs/README for additional comments
		#  on certificates.
		#
		#  If OpenSSL was not found at the time the server was
		#  built, the "tls", "ttls", and "peap" sections will
		#  be ignored.
		#
		#  Otherwise, when the server first starts in debugging
		#  mode, test certificates will be created.  See the
		#  "make_cert_command" below for details, and the README
		#  file in raddb/certs
		#
		#  These test certificates SHOULD NOT be used in a normal
		#  deployment.  They are created only to make it easier
		#  to install the server, and to perform some simple
		#  tests with EAP-TLS, TTLS, or PEAP.
		#
		#  See also:
		#
		#  http://www.dslreports.com/forum/remark,9286052~mode=flat
		#
		#  Note that you should NOT use a globally known CA here!
		#  e.g. using a Verisign cert as a "known CA" means that
		#  ANYONE who has a certificate signed by them can
		#  authenticate via EAP-TLS!  This is likely not what you want.

			#
			#  For now, the identity is fixed, and must be the

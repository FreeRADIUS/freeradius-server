#  = PAP Module
#
#  The `pap` module accepts a large number of formats for the _known good_ (reference)
#  password, such as crypt hashes, md5 hashes, and etc.
#  The module takes the `User-Password` and performs the necessary transformations of the
#  user submitted password to match the copy of the password the server has retrieved.
#
#  For instructions on creating the various types of passwords,
#  see http://www.openldap.org/faq/data/cache/347.html
#

#
#  ## Default instance
#
pap {
	#
	#  normalise::
	#
	#  By default the server will use heuristics to try and automatically
	#  handle base64 or hex encoded passwords. This behaviour can be
	#  stopped by setting the following to `no`.
	#
	#  The default is `yes`
	#
#	normalise = no
}

#  An instance of the passwd module designed for looking up
#  DHCP client membership.  This example is based on hardware
#  address.
#  The "groups" file should be of the format:
#  <group name>|<hardware address>,<hardware address>,<hardware address>
#  <group name>|<hardware address>,<hardware address>,<hardware address>
#
#  See the passwd module for more details.

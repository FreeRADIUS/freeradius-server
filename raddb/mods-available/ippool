#  Do server side ip pool management. Should be added in
#  post-auth and accounting sections.
#
#  The module also requires the existence of the Pool-Name
#  attribute. That way the administrator can add the Pool-Name
#  attribute in the user profiles and use different pools for
#  different users. The Pool-Name attribute is a *check* item
#  not a reply item.
#
#  The Pool-Name should be set to the ippool module instance
#  name or to DEFAULT to match any module.

#
# Example:
# radiusd.conf: ippool students { [...] }
#		ippool teachers { [...] }
# users file  : DEFAULT Group == students, Pool-Name := "students"
#		DEFAULT Group == teachers, Pool-Name := "teachers"
#		DEFAULT	Group == other, Pool-Name := "DEFAULT"
#
# ********* IF YOU CHANGE THE RANGE PARAMETERS YOU MUST *********
# ********* THEN ERASE THE DB FILES                     *********

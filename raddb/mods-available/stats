#
#  The "stats" module tracks RADIUS statistics.
#
#  It should be listed LAST in any "send ... { }" section.
#
#  When listed in a "send" section, it will increment statistics for
#  input / output packets.
#
#  When listed in a "recv Status-Server" section, it will add global
#  server statistics to the packet.  See "dictionary.freeradius", and
#  the "FreeRADIUS-Stats4" attributes, for a list of which attributes
#  it adds.

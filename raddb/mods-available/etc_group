#  = etc_group Module
#
#  The `etc_group` module provides group names from the `/etc/group` file.
#
#  NOTE: Please see the `csv` module for full documentation on the
#  configuration items used here.
#

#
#  ## Configuration Settings
#
#  The `csv` module configuration for the /etc/group file.  The module
#  adds a `Etc-Group-Name` attribute for every group that the user is
#  a member of.
#
#  You will have to define the `Etc-Group-Name` in the `dictionary` file,
#  as a `string` type.  For example:
#
#	ATTRIBUTE Etc-Group-Name string 3020
#
#  We cannot use the `Group` attribute here.  The `Group` attribute is
#  automatically created by the `unix` module, and checked against
#  `/etc/group` automatically.  Which means that the `Group` attribute
#  has a pre-defined meaning, and you *cannot* use it for this module.
#
csv etc_group {
	filename = ${modconfdir}/csv/${.:instance}
	delimiter = ":"
	header = no

	key = &User-Name

	#
	#  The field names are just place-holders.
	#  They are NOT attribute names!
	#
	fields = "group:::,user"

	index_field = user

	#
	#  Add the ETC-Group-Name attribute to the request list.
	#  If the user is a member of multiple groups, then the
	#  module will add multiple ETC-Group-Name attributes,
	#  one for each group.
	#
	#  The field names from the `fields` entry above are used
	#  here in the right-hand side of the `update` section.
	#
	update request {
	       &ETC-Group-Name := 'group'
	}
}

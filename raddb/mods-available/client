#  = Client Module
#
#  The `client` module loads RADIUS clients as needed, rather than when the server
#  starts.
#
#  This module is listed in the `new client { ... }` section of a virtual server to read
#  client definitions from FreeRADIUS config files transforming them into attributes.
#  These attributes are then used by the server to create internal client definitions.
#
#  This indirection is necessary as client definitions can be provided by many different
#  modules (`ldap`, `sql`, `couchbase` etc...), all of which emit client data in
#  attribute form.  Treating static configuration files specially would increase code
#  complexity.
#
#  There are no configuration entries for this module. Instead, it relies on the `client`
#  configuration.
#
#  You must:
#
#  1. Link `raddb/sites-enabled/dynamic_clients` to `raddb/sites-available/dynamic_clients`.
#
#  2. Define a client network/mask (see the top of `raddb/sites-enabled/dynamic_clients).
#
#  3. Uncomment the `directory` entry in that client definition.
#
#  4. List `client` in the `new client { .. }` section of the `client` virtual server.
#  The default example already does this.
#
#  5. Put files into the above directory, one per IP.  e.g. file `192.0.2.1` should contain
#  a normal client definition
#  for a client with IP address `192.0.2.1`.
#
#  NOTE: For more documentation, see the file `raddb/sites-available/dynamic-clients`
#

#
#  ## Client Configuration
#
#  In addition to loading `client` definitions in from flat files, the clients module can
#  also be used to access data from previously defined clients.
#

#
#  ### Attribute Mapping
#
#  Maps arbitrary fields from a client definition to attributes in the current request.
#
#  [source,unlang]
#  ---
#  map client [<ipaddr>] {            // <1>
#       &Tmp-String-0 = 'nas_type'    // <2>
#       &Tmp-String-1 := 'shortname'  // <3>
#       &Tmp-String-3 += 'groups'     // <4>
#  }
#  ---
#
#  <1> By default `map client { ... }` will operate on the current client, but alternative
#      clients can by specified by `<ipaddr>`.
#  <2> Assigns the value of the `nas_type` field from the client definition to
#      `&Tmp-String-0` if `&Tmp-String-0` doesn't exist.
#  <3> Assigns the value of the `shortname` field from the client definition to
#      `&Tmp-String-1`.
#  <4> Creates multiple `&Tmp-String-3` attributes from a custom group field associated
#      with the client.

#
#  ### Access Expansion
#
#  [options="header,autowidth"]
#  |===
#  | XLAT                          | Description
#  | `%{client:nas_type}`          | Expands to client's `nas_type` (or "" if nas_type not set).
#  | `%{client:<ipaddr>.nas_type}` | Expands to the `nas_type` of the client specified
#                                    by `<ipaddr>` (or "" if `nas_type` not set).

#  ## Configuration Settings

#  This module takes no configuration.

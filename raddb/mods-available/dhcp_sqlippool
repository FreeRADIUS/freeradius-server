#  Configuration for DHCP for the SQL based IP Pools module (rlm_sqlippool).
#
#  See raddb/mods-available/sqlippool for common configuration explanation
#
#  See raddb/policy.d/dhcp_sqlippool for the "glue" code that allows
#  the RADIUS based "sqlippool" module to be used for DHCP.
#
#  See raddb/sites-available/dhcp for instructions on how to configure
#  the DHCP server.

	#  RFC 2132 allows the DHCP client to supply a unique
	#  identifier ("uid") using Option 61 (DHCP-Client-Identifier)
	#  in which case it must be used as the lookup key for
	#  configuration data.

	#  The "uid" is generated by the OS which means that clients
	#  whose BMC piggybacks on the main interface (sharing its MAC,
	#  but generating a distinct uid) and dual-booting clients can
	#  be allocated multiple IPs, consuming more pool entries. To
	#  avoid this you can ignore the RFCs and key the configuration
	#  data based only on the client MAC address.

#  = DHCP SQL-IP-Pool Module
#
#  The module `dhcp_sqlippool` provides configuration for `DHCP` to use `SQL IP Pools`.
#
#  [NOTE]
#  ====
#  * See the `raddb/policy.d/dhcp_sqlippool` for the "glue" code that allows
#  the RADIUS based `sqlippool` module to be used for DHCP.
#  * See `raddb/sites-available/dhcp` for instructions on how to configure the DHCP server.

	#  RFC 2132 allows the DHCP client to supply a unique
	#  identifier ("uid") using Option 61 (DHCP-Client-Identifier)
	#  in which case it must be used as the lookup key for
	#  configuration data.
	#
	pool_key = "%{%{DHCP-Client-Identifier}:-%{DHCP-Client-Hardware-Address}}"
	#
	#  The "uid" is generated by the OS which means that clients
	#  whose BMC piggybacks on the main interface (sharing its MAC,
	#  but generating a distinct uid) and dual-booting clients can
	#  be allocated multiple IPs, consuming more pool entries. To
	#  avoid this you can ignore the RFCs and key the configuration
	#  data based only on the client MAC address.
	#
	#  pool_key = "%{DHCP-Client-Hardware-Address}"

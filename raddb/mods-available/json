# JSON module registers a map function to allow mapping fields from JSON
# structures to attributes.
#
# The path through the JSON object is specified with fr jpath, which is
# the FreeRADIUS implementation of the jpath grammar described here:
#
#	http://goessner.net/articles/JsonPath/
#
# rlm_json currently implements a subset of the grammar described by the
# above implementation.
#
# Selectors currently implemented are:
#   - $          Root node (only valid at the start of the path).
#   - @          Current node (only valid at the start of the path).
#   - .<name>    A field within an object.
#   - [<idx>]    Index within an array.
#   - [<start>:<end>[:<step>]]  A slice within an array (identical to the Python syntax).
#   - [<idx>,<start>:<end>]     Multiple indexes/slices within an array.
#   - .*         All the children of the current node
#
# Automatic casting will occur between JSON and attribute types where possible.
#
# FreeRADIUS does not currently have a signed64 or floating point type, to map
# large signed numbers and JSON doubles to.  These may instead be written to
# string type attributes.
#
# Assignment of JSON objects/arrays to strings is supported, in which case the
# JSON serialized form of the object/array is used.
#
# If a jpath matches multiple nodes, unless the map includes the += operator
# only the first node's value will be used.
# If the map uses += then multiple instances of the attribute will be created,
# each holding a different node value.
#
# Simple example:
# {
#	"user": "bob",
#	"account number": 7124503,
#	"groups": {
#		"admin",
#		"networks",
#		"bob"
#	}
#
# }
#
# map json "%{rest:GET http://example.org/api/user/%{User-Name}" {
#	&Tmp-Integer-0 	:= '$.account number'
#	&Group		+= '$.groups.*"
# }
json {

}

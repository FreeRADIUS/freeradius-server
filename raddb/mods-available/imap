#  = Imap Module
#
#  This modules validates a gives user-name user-password combination.
#  If called in Authenticate, it will look for User-Name and User-Password in Access-Request.
#  If it can find both a username and password, the module will prepare an imap login request with those credentials.
#
#  This module can optionally perform a tls handshake, enabled with require_cert
#

	#  how FreeRADIUS connects to a imap server.

		#  ca_file:: PEM formatted file containing the chain to validate the imap server's cert
		#
		#  Should usually contain a concatenation of one or more intermediary CA
		#  files, shallowest (i.e. the one that signed the imap server's cert) first, and
		#  deepest (the root CA) last.
		#
		#  Providing a complete certificate chain here is the most common way of validating
		#  the certificate presented by a imap server.

		#
		#  Specifies the certificate that directly signed the certificate presented by the
		#  imaps server.
		#
		#  This configuration option can be used to prevent certificates passing validation that
		#  were signed by other intermediary CAs or root CAs in the trusted certificate chain.

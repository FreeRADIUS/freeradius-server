#  = IMAP Module
#
#  The `imap` module validates a users name and password against an IMAP server.
#  It should be called from an `authenticate` section.
#
#  The module can optionally perform a tls handshake, enabled with require_cert
#

imap {
	#
	#  tls { ... }:: Configure the tls related items which control
	#  how FreeRADIUS connects to an IMAP server.
	#
	tls {
		#
		#  .Certificate validation options
		#
		#  Specifies how the certificate(s) presented by the
		#  IMAP server are validated, and which certificates
		#  (if any) to send to that IMAP server.
		#
		#  The options here behave the same as the options in
		#  other `tls` sections in the server.
		#

		#
		#  certificate_file:: PEM formatted file containing the certificate we present to the IMAP server
		#
		#  Specifies a certificate and any intermediary CAs we should send to the IMAP server.
		#
		#  This file should usually contain the client certificate file first, then any
		#  intermediary signing CAs, shallowest (direct signee of the certificate_file)
		#  to deepest (signed directly by the root CA).
		#
#		certificate_file     = /path/to/radius.pem

		#
		#  ca_file:: PEM formatted file containing the chain
		#  to validate the IMAP server's certificate.
		#
		#  Any certificate chain MUST be in order from server
		#  certificate (first in the file) to intermediary CAs (second) to
		#  Root CA (last in the file) as per RFC 4346 Section 7.4.2 (see certificate_list)
		#
		#  Providing a complete certificate chain here is the
		#  most common way of validating the certificate
		#  presented by an IMAP server.
		#
#		ca_file	             = "${certdir}/cacert.pem"

		#
		#  ca_issuer_file:: PEM formatted file containing the
		#  CA that signed the IMAP server's certificate.
		#
		#  Specifies the certificate which directly signed
		#  the certificate presented by the IMAPs server.
		#
		#  This configuration option can be used to prevent
		#  certificates passing validation which were signed
		#  by other intermediary CAs, or root CAs, in the
		#  trusted certificate chain.
		#
#		ca_issuer_file     = "${certdir}/caissuer.pem"

		#
		#  ca_path:: A directory containing multiple root CA certs named by their hash.
		#
		#  See the OpenSSL documentation for more details:
		#  - https://www.openssl.org/docs/man1.1.0/man3/SSL_CTX_set_default_verify_paths.html
		#  - https://www.openssl.org/docs/man1.1.1/man1/c_rehash.html
		#
		#  This configuration option should only be used when the IMAP server being contacted
		#  is not known ahead of time (using a URL from an external source), and/or the CA used
		#  to sign the IMAP server certificate is unknown.
		#
#		ca_path	             = "${certdir}"

		#
		#  private_key_file:: PEM formatted file containing the private key for the specified `certificate_file`
		#
		#  This item must be specified if `certificate_file` is being used.
		#
#		private_key_file     = /path/to/radius.key

		#
		#  private_key_password:: Password used to decrypt the `private_key_file`.
		#
#		private_key_password = "supersecret"

		#
		#  random_file:: Source of random data used for various cryptographic functions.
		#
#		random_file          = /dev/urandom

		#
		#  check_cert:: Server certificate verification requirements.
		#
		#  May be one of:
		#
		#  [options="header,autowidth"]
		#  |===
		#  | Option | Description
		#  | `no`   | Server certificate can be signed by any CA or be self-signed.
		#  | `yes`  | Server certificate must be issued by one of the trusted CAs.
		#  |===
		#
		#  Default is `yes`
		#
#		check_cert = no

		#
		#  request_cert:: Options for controlling how the
		#  module requests TLS to the IMAP server.
		#
		#  May be one of:
		#
		#  [options="header,autowidth"]
		#  |===
		#  | Option | Description
		#  | `demand`   | Require ssl validation to accept login
		#  | `never`  | Do not try to establish ssl connection
		#  | `allow`  | Try to establish ssl connection, continue even if it cannot
		#  |===
		#
		#  default is 'allow'
		#
#		require_cert = allow

		#
		#  check_cert_cn:: Server certificate CN verification requirements.
		#
		#  May be one of:
		#
		#  [options="header,autowidth"]
		#  |===
		#  | Option | Description
		#  | `no`   | Server certificate CN can be any value.
		#  | `yes`  | Server certificate CN matches the host in the URI.
		#  |===
		#
		#  Default is `yes`
		#
#		check_cert_cn = no

		#
		#  extract_cert_attrs:: Extract OIDs from presented certificates as OIDs.
		#
		#  Default is `no`
		#
#		extract_cert_attrs = no
	}

	#
	#  uri:: URI which will be used for connecting to the IMAP server.
	#
	#  The `imap` module uses Curl (https://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/) to implement
	#  the underlying mail protocols.  The URI should be in the form of:
	#
	#  `SCHEME://IP:PORT/`
	#

	#	`SCHEME` can be one of the protocols supported by Curl.
	#	i.e. ftp, ftps, gopher, http, https, imap, imaps, ldap, ldaps,
	#	     pop3, pop3s, rtsp, scp, sftp, smb, smbs, smtp, smtps.
	#	If no `SCHEME` is given, it defaults to `imap`.
	#
	#	`IP` is the IP address of the server.  It can be an IPv4 address,
	#	IPv6 address, hostname, etc.
	#
	#	`PORT` is optional, and will normally be chosen to be correct
	#	for the given `SCHEME`.
	#
	#  For more information, see the CURL documentation at
	#
	#	https://ec.haxx.se/cmdline/cmdline-urls
	#
	uri = "imap://192.0.20.1/"

	#
	#  timeout:: How long the module will wait before giving up on the response
	#  from the IMAP server.
	#
	timeout = 5s

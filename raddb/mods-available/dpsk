#
#  Calculate dynamic PSKs
#
#  This module needs the following attributes as input:
#
#	* control:Pre-Shared-Key -  the PSK for the user
#	* User-Name - the supplicant MAC in hex format, e.g. "abcdef012345"
#	* Called-Station-MAC - the AP MAC in binary
#	  this attribute is set by the "rewrite_called_station_id" policy.
#	* FreeRADIUS-802.1X-Anonce - from the AP
#	* FreeRADIUS-802.1X-EAPoL-Key-Msg - from the AP
#
#  Note that you MUST run the "rewrite_called_station_id" policy before calling this module.
#
#  That policy MUST also create the Called-Station-MAC attribute.
#
#  Then place the following configuration into the "authorize" section:
#
#	authorize {
#		...
#		rewrite_called_station_id
#
#		dpsk
#		if (ok) {
#			update control {
#				&PSK-Identity := "bob"
#				&Pre-Shared-Key := "this-is-super-secret"
#			}
#		}
#
#	}
#
#  Alternatively, you can read &control:PSK-Identity and
#  &control:Pre-Shared-Key from a database.  Just do that before
#  running the "authenticate" section.  You can do the database lookup
#  after running the "dpsk" module in the "authorize" section.
#
#  The database should look up the User-Name (i.e. MAC), and then set
#  &control:PSK-Identity and &control:Pre-Shared-Key.  In general, it
#  is easiest to just set PSK-Identity to be same as the User-Name.
#
#  Then update the "authenticate" section to list the "dpsk" module:
#
#	authenticate {
#		...
#
#		Auth-Type dpsk {
#			dpsk
#			if (updated) {
#				... cache &reply:Pre-Shared-Key
#				... cache &reply:PSK-Identity
#
#			}
#		}
#
#		...
#	}
#
#  In the "authenticate" section, the module will return
#
#  * noop	if there are no DPSK attributes in the request
#
#  * fail	if there are DPSK attributes, but it is unable to get the
#		information necessary to check the DPSK data.
#
#  * reject 	if there are DPSK attributes, but they do not match any
#		given PSK.
#
#  * ok		if there are DPSK attributes, and they match a known PSK.
#
#  * updated	if there are DPSK attributes which match a PSK, and the
#		PSK was read from 'filename'.
#
#		It also updates the attributes &reply:Pre-Shared-Key
#		with the found PSK, along with &reply:PSK-Identity
#		with the found identity.
#
#		You can then check the return code for "updated", and
#		write those attributes into a database.  This step
#		ensures that 'filename' is read only as a last resort.
#		Since the file is read from top to bottom for every
#		packet, this process is much slower than using a
#		database which is keyed to the PSK Identity.
#
#  We STRONGLY RECOMMEND THAT NO ONE USE THIS MODULE.
#
#  While it works, it needs to use a brute-force method to match MAC
#  to PSK.  That process is extremely slow, and scales very poorly.
#
#  i.e. if you have 10 PSKs, it's not too bad.  If you have 10,000
#  PSKs, then the module can comsume 100% of CPU trying to
#  brute-force every PSK.
#
#  This is a limitation of how DPSK works.  There is no way to make it
#  better.  The only thing we've done is to add a cache which can help
#  to minimize the amount of brute-force attempts.
#

#
#  The modules configuration.
#
dpsk {
	#
	#  The maximum number of entries to cache.
	#
	#  The cache is keyed by (supplicant MAC + SSID)
	#
	#  The cache entry is the PSK-Identity and Pre-Shared-Key,
	#  and/or the PMK which are used to verify the information in
	#  the Access-Request.
	#
	#  Caching entries can help, even when using a database.  It
	#  is very slow to calculate the PMK from the PSK.
	#
	cache_size = 1024

	#
	#  The lifetime of an entry in the cache.
	#
	cache_lifetime = 86400

	#
	#  PSKs can also be stored in a CSV file.  The format of the file is:
	#
	#	identity,psk,mac
	#
	#  If there are commas in a field, then the field can be
	#  double quoted: "psk".
	#
	#  The mac field is optional.  If it exists, then that PSK
	#  will be used.  It is highly recommended that the MAC *not* be placed
	#  into the CSV file.  Instead, the MAC and PSK should be placed into a
	#  database.  The server can then be configured to look up the MAC in the
	#  database, which returns the PSK.  That way this module will only ever
	#  check one PSK, which is fast.
	#
	#  i.e. the CSV file should only contain the small number of PSKs where
	#  you do not yet know the MAC.  As soon as you know the MAC, you should
	#  put the MAC and PSK into a database, and then remove the MAC and PSK
	#  from the CSV file.
	#
	#  NOTE: the file is opened and read from top to bottom for every
	#  new request which comes in.  This process can be very slow!
	#
	#  However, opening the file for every new request means that the
	#  server does not have to be reloaded when the file changes.  Instead,
	#  the file can be generated, and then moved into place atomically:
	#
	# 	create csv file > psk.csv.new
	#	mv psk.csv.new psk.csv
	#
	#  Any process which writes a new "psk.csv" file MUST NOT
	#  write to the file directly, as that will cause the dpsk
	#  module to read partial entries and fail.  Instead, use "mv"
	#  to atomically overwrite the old file with a new one.
	#
	#  Both "cache_size" and "filename" can be configured at the
	#  same time, which is recommended.  When an entry in the file
	#  is found, the identity, PSK, and MAC are saved in the cache.
	#
	#  If a cache entry is found, then the filename is NOT read.
	#
	#  The resulting combination of features means that the module
	#  should be as fast as possible, given the limitations of DPSK.
	#
	#  NOTE: Tests show that the module can do ~100K PSK / DPSK
	#  checks per second.  This means that if you have 10,000
	#  users and 10 packets a second, the system will be 100% busy
	#  checking PSKs.  Similarly, of you have 100K DPSKs in the file,
	#  the one packet will take 1 second of CPU time to verify!
	#
	#  As a result, the DPSK functionality scales poorly.  It
	#  should be used only with a small number of PSKs (100s
	#  perhaps), and only at low packet rates.  If the server is
	#  getting 1000 packets per second, then it can only handle
	#  100 PSKs before running out of CPU.
	#
	#  Using the cache will help substantially.  But the cache is
	#  only in memory, which means that all cache entries are lost
	#  when the server restarts.  As a result, the combination of
	#  number of PSKs and packet rates should be kept as low as
	#  possible.
	#
	#  The filename is dynamically expanded, so it can reference
	#  other attributes.  This expansion lets you split up DPSK
	#  files by location, which can drastically reduce the overall
	#  search space, and thus the CPU requirements.
	#
#	filename = "${modconfdir}/${..:name}/psk.csv"

#
#  The 'expression' module currently has no configuration.
#
#  This module is useful only for 'xlat'.  To use it,
#  put 'expr' into the 'instantiate' section.  You can then
#  do dynamic translation of attributes like:
#
#  Attribute-Name = `%{expr:2 + 3 + %{exec: uid -u}}`
#
#  The value of the attribute will be replaced with the output
#  of the program which is executed.  Due to RADIUS protocol
#  limitations, any output over 253 bytes will be ignored.
#
#  The module also registers a few paircompare functions

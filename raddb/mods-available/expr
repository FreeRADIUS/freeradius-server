#
#  This module performs mathematical calculations:
#
#	Attribute-Name = "%{expr:2 + 3 + &NAS-Port}"
#
#  It supports the following operators (in order of precedence)
#
#	&	binary AND
#	|	binary OR
#	<<	left shift
#	>>	right shift
#	+	addition
#	-	subtraction
#	*	multiply
#	/	divide
#	%%	remainder
#	^	exponentiation
#	(...)	sub-expression
#
#  Operator precedence follows the normal rules.
#  Division by zero means that the entire expression is invalid.
#
#  Note that in versions before 3.0.5, the expression
#  was parsed strictly left to right, and ignored operator
#  precedence.
#
#  It also allows unary negation:	-1
#  And logical invert:			!1
#
#  All calculations are done on signed 63-bit integers.
#  e.g. int64_t.  This should be sufficient for all normal
#  purposes.
#
#  Hex numbers are supported:		0xabcdef
#
#  As with all string expansions, you can nest the expansions:
#
#	%{expr: %{NAS-Port} + 1}
#	%{expr: %{sql:SELECT ... } + 1}
#
#  Attribute references are supported for integer attributes.
#  e.g. &NAS-Port.  The benefit of using attribute references
#  is that the expression is calculated directly on the
#  attribute.  It skips the step so "print to string, and then
#  parse to number".
#
#  Otherwise, all numbers are decimal.
#

#
#  The module also registers a few paircompare functions, and
#  many string manipulation functions, which should really be
#  documented here.

#  = redundant_sql Module
#
#  The `redundant_sql` module handles SQL expansions in a redundant manner.
#
#
#  This configuration can be thought of as a `virtual` module.
#
#  e.g. If you have two redundant SQL servers, and you want to use
#  them in the authorize and accounting sections, you could place a
#  `redundant` block in each section, containing the exact same text.
#  Or, you could uncomment the following lines, and list
#  `redundant_sql` in the authorize and accounting sections.
#
#  The `virtual` module defined here can also be used with dynamic
#  expansions, under a few conditions:
#
#  * The section is one of `group`, `redundant`, `load-balance`, or
#    `redundant-load-balance`
#  * The section contains module names ONLY, and no sub-sections
#  * All modules in the section are using the same
#    driver, e.g. They are all sql, or all ldap, etc.
#
#  When those conditions are satisfied, the server will
#  automatically register a dynamic expansion, using the
#  name of the `virtual` module.  In the example below,
#  it will be `redundant_sql`.  You can then use this expansion
#  just like any other:
#
#  	&reply.Filter-Id := "%{redundant_sql: ... }"
#
#  In this example, the expansion is done via module `sql1`, and if
#  that expansion fails, using module `sql2`.
#
#  For best results, configure the `pool` subsection of the module so
#  that `retry_delay` is non-zero.  That will allow the redundant
#  block to quickly ignore all "down" SQL databases.  If instead we
#  have `retry_delay = 0`, then every time the redundant block is
#  used, the server will try to open a connection to every `down`
#  database, causing problems.

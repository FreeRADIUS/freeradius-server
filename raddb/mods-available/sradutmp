#  "Safe" radutmp - does not contain caller ID, so it can be
#  world-readable, and radwho can work for normal users, without
#  exposing any information that isn't already exposed by who(1).
#
#  This is another 'instance' of the radutmp module, but it is given
#  then name "sradutmp" to identify it later in the "accounting"
#  section.
#
#  'utmp' files are becoming obsolete. You should use a database
#  instead.

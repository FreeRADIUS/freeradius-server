# The logintime module. This handles the Login-Time,
# Current-Time, and Time-Of-Day attributes.  It should be
# included in the *end* of the authorize section in order to
# handle Login-Time checks. It should also be included in the
# instantiate section in order to register the Current-Time
# and Time-Of-Day comparison functions.
#
# When the Login-Time attribute is set to some value, and the
# user has bene permitted to log in, a Session-Timeout is
# calculated based on the remaining time.  See "doc/README".

	# to have. If the calculated timeout is lower we don't
	# allow the logon. Some NASes do not handle values
	# lower than 60 seconds well.

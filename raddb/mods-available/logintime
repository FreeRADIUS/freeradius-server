#  = Login time Module
#
#  The `logintime` module handles the `Login-Time`, `Current-Time`,
#  and `Time-Of-Day` attributes.
#
#  It should be included in the *end* of the `recv Access-Request`
#  section in order to handle `Login-Time` checks.
#
#  When the `Login-Time` attribute is set to some value, and the user
#  has been permitted to log in, the `Session-Timeout` will be
#  calculated based on the remaining time.  Note that this is a
#  *maximum* value.  If another module sets `Session-Timeout` to a
#  lower value, the `logintime` module will not increase its value.
#

#
#  ## Configuration Settings
#
logintime {
	#
	#  minimum_timeout::
	#
	#  The minimum timeout (in seconds) a user is allowed
	#  to have. If the calculated timeout is lower we don't
	#  allow the login.
	#
	#  NOTE: Some NAS do not handle values lower than 60 seconds.
	#  They will either ignore the result, or set it to some
	#  larger value.
	#
	#  Default is `60`.
	#
	minimum_timeout = 60
}

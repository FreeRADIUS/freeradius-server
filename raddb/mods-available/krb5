		#  NOTE: All configuration settings are enforced.  If a
		#  connection is closed because of "idle_timeout",
		#  "uses", or "lifetime", then the total number of
		#  connections MAY fall below "min".  When that
		#  happens, it will open a new connection.  It will
		#  also log a WARNING message.
		#
		#  The solution is to either lower the "min" connections,
		#  or increase lifetime/idle_timeout.

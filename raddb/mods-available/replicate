#  Replicate packet(s) to a home server.
#
#  This module will open a new socket for each packet, and "clone"
#  the incoming packet to the destination realm (i.e. home server).
#
#  Use it by setting "Replicate-To-Realm = name" in the control list,
#  just like Proxy-To-Realm.  The configurations for the two attributes
#  are identical.  The realm must exist, the home_server_pool must exist,
#  and the home_server must exist.
#
#  The only difference is that the "replicate" module sends requests
#  and does not expect a reply.  Any reply is ignored.
#
#  Both Replicate-To-Realm and Proxy-To-Realm can be used at the same time.
#
#  To use this module, list "replicate" in the "authorize" or
#  "accounting" section.  Then, ensure that Replicate-To-Realm is set.
#  The contents of the "packet" attribute list will be sent to the
#  home server.  The usual load-balancing, etc. features of the home
#  server will be used.
#
#  "radmin" can be used to mark home servers alive/dead, in order to
#  enable/disable replication to specific servers.
#
#  Packets can be replicated to multiple destinations.  Just set
#  Replicate-To-Realm multiple times.  One packet will be sent for
#  each of the Replicate-To-Realm attribute in the "control" list.
#
#  If no packets are sent, the module returns "noop".  If at least one
#  packet is sent, the module returns "ok".  If an error occurs, the
#  module returns "fail"
#
#  Note that replication does NOT change any of the packet statistics.
#  If you use "radmin" to look at the statistics for a home server,
#  the replicated packets will cause NO counters to increment.  This
#  is not a bug, this is how replication works.

#  = Lua Module
#
#  The `lua` module processes attributes through a Lua interpreter.
#
#  * Please see the `src/modules/rlm_lua/example.lua` for a sample Lua script.
#  * Please see https://www.lua.org/ for more information about the Lua language.
#
#  The Lua function names called when the `lua` module is called are
#  automatically derived from the section in which they are called.
#
#  If `lua` is called in `recv Access-Request`, firstly a function
#  `recv_access_request` will be looked for.  If that does not exist, then
#  a function `recv` will be looked for.
#
#  This can be overridden by setting `func_recv_access_request` or `func_recv`
#  to point to a different function name.
#

#
#  ## Configuration Settings
#
lua {
	#
	#  filename:: Module to load functions from.
	#
	filename = ${modconfdir}/${.:instance}/example.lua

	#
	#  func_instantiate:: Called on module instantiation.
	#
#	func_instantiate = instantiate

	#
	#  func_detach:: Called on module unload.
	#
#	func_detach = detach
}

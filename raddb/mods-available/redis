#  = REDIS Module
#
#  The `redis` module handles connections to a redis database,
#  and the `%redis( ...)` dynamic expansion.
#
#  See also https://redis.io/documentation for documentation on the
#  Redis database.
#

#
#  == Configuration Settings
#
#  This module connects to a Redis database.  Other modules
#  (e.g. `redis_ippool`) perform task-specific functions using Redis.
#
redis {
	#
	#  server:: The server to connect to.
	#
	#  If using Redis cluster, multiple 'bootstrap' servers may be
	#  listed here (as separate config items). These will be contacted
	#  in turn until one provides us with a valid map for the cluster.
	#
	#  Server strings may contain unique ports e.g.:
	#
	#    server = '127.0.0.1:30001'
	#    server = '[::1]:30002'
	#
	#  NOTE: Instantiation failure behaviour is controlled by `pool.start`
	#  as with every other module, but with clustering, the `pool { ... }`
	#  section determines limits for each node in the cluster, not the
	#  cluster as a whole.
	#
	server = 127.0.0.1

	#
	#  database:: Select the Redis logical database having the specified zero-based numeric index.
	#
#	database = 0

	#
	#  port:: Port to connect to
	#  The default port is 6379.
	#
	port = 6379

	#
	#  password:: The password used to authenticate to the server.
	#
	#  We recommend using a strong password.
	#
#	password = thisisreallysecretandhardtoguess

	#
	#  use_tls:: Use TLS (requires hiredis 1.0+)
	#
	#  TLS parameters can be specified in the optional adjacent tls {} section
	#
#	use_tls = no
#	tls { }

	#
	#  use_cluster_map:: Use cluster map
	#
	#  Build cluster map during initialization.
	#
	#  The cluster client can operate, albeit inefficiently, without a cluster map
	#  by following '-ASK' and '-MOVE' redirects.
	#
	#  Disabling cluster map can be required for stunnel-based deployments.
	#  Alternatively, cluster map is not built during initialization when pool.start == 0
	#
#	use_cluster_map = yes

	#  lua { ... }::
	#
	#  Configuration options which control the execution of lua scripts
	#  on redis nodes.
	#
	lua {
		#
		#  function <name> { ... }::
		#
		#  Every function section listed here will be registered as an expansion with a name
		#  in the format `<inst>.<name>`.
		#
		#  For example the function below would be callable as `%redis.hello_world(...)`.
		#
		#  expansion functions take the same arguments as the redis `EVALSHA` command,
		#  i.e. `<numkeys> [<key> [<key> ...]] [<arg> [<arg> ...]]`.
		#
		#  `numkeys` specifies how many of the proceeding arguments should be treated as keys.
		#
		#  The redis module will use the first key to determine which cluster node the function
		#  should called on.
		#
		#  The redis module pre-calcualtes the SHA1 hash of all lua functions on startup.
		#  When an expansion function is called, it uses the `EVALSHA` command to attempt to
		#  call lua function on a remote redis node.  If `EVALSHA` fails with an error indicating
		#  no script could be found with the calculated SHA1 hash, the lua function will be
		#  loaded transparently using `SCRIPT LOAD`.
		#
		function hello_world {
			#
			#  body:: Lua code to send to redis nodes with SCRIPT LOAD
			#
			body = 'return "hello world"'
		}
	}

	#
	#  pool { ... }::
	#
	#  Information for the connection pool.  The configuration items below
	#  are the same for all modules which use the new connection pool.
	#
	pool {
		#
		#  start:: Connections to create during module instantiation.
		#
		#  If the server cannot create specified number of
		#  connections during instantiation it will exit.
		#  Set to `0` to allow the server to start without the
		#  external service being available.
		#
		start = 0

		#
		#  min:: Minimum number of connections to keep open.
		#
		min = 0

		#
		#  max:: Maximum number of connections.
		#
		#  If these connections are all in use and a new one
		#  is requested, the request will NOT get a connection.
		#
		#  Setting `max` to *LESS* than the number of threads means
		#  that some threads may starve, and you will see errors
		#  like _No connections available and at max connection limit_.
		#
		#  Setting `max` to MORE than the number of threads means
		#  that there are more connections than necessary.
		#
		#  If `max` is not specified, then it defaults to the number
		#  of workers configured.
		#
#		max =

		#
		#  spare:: Spare connections to be left idle.
		#
		#  NOTE: Idle connections WILL be closed if `idle_timeout`
		#  is set.  This should be less than or equal to `max` above.
		#
		spare = 1

		#
		#  uses:: Number of uses before the connection is closed.
		#
		#  NOTE: `0` means "infinite".
		#
		uses = 0

		#
		#  retry_delay:: The number of seconds to wait after the server tries
		#  to open a connection, and fails.
		#
		#  During this time, no new connections will be opened.
		#
		retry_delay = 30

		#
		#  lifetime:: The lifetime (in seconds) of the connection.
		#
		#  NOTE: `0` means "infinite".
		#
		lifetime = 86400

		#
		#  cleanup_interval:: The pool is checked for free connections every
		#  `cleanup_interval`.
		#
		#  If there are free connections, then one of them is closed.
		#
		cleanup_interval = 300

		#
		#  idle_timeout:: The idle timeout (in seconds).
		#
		#  A connection which is unused for this length of time will be closed.
		#
		#  NOTE: `0` means "infinite".
		#
		idle_timeout = 600

		#
		#  connect_timeout:: Connection timeout (in seconds).
		#
		#  The maximum amount of time to wait for a new connection to be established.
		#
		connect_timeout = 3.0

		#
		#  [NOTE]
		#  ====
		#  All configuration settings are enforced.  If a connection is closed because of
		#  `idle_timeout`, `uses`, or `lifetime`, then the total number of connections MAY
		#  fall below `min`.
		#
		#  When that happens, it will open a new connection.  It will also log a *WARNING*
		#  message.
		#
		#  The solution is to either lower the "min" connections,
		#  or increase lifetime/idle_timeout.

		#  is requested, the request will NOT get a connection.
		#
		#  Setting 'max' to LESS than the number of threads means
		#  that some threads may starve, and you will see errors
		#  like 'No connections available and at max connection limit'
		#
		#  Setting 'max' to MORE than the number of threads means
		#  that there are more connections than necessary.
		max = ${thread[pool].max_servers}

		#
		#  NOTE: A setting of 0 means infinite (no limit).

		#
		#  NOTE: A setting of 0 means infinite (no timeout).
		idle_timeout = 600

		#  NOTE: All configuration settings are enforced.  If a
		#  connection is closed because of "idle_timeout",
		#  "uses", or "lifetime", then the total number of
		#  connections MAY fall below "min".  When that
		#  happens, it will open a new connection.  It will
		#  also log a WARNING message.
		#
		#  The solution is to either lower the "min" connections,
		#  or increase lifetime/idle_timeout.

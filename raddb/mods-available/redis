	#  If using Redis cluster, multiple 'bootstrap' servers may be
	#  listed here (as separate config items). These will be contacted
	#  in turn until one provides us with a valid map for the cluster.
	#  Server strings may contain unique ports e.g.:
	#
	#    server = '127.0.0.1:30001'
	#    server = '[::1]:30002'
	#
	#  Instantiation failure behaviour is controlled by pool.start as
	#  with every other module, but with clustering, the pool section
	#  determines limits for each node in the cluster, not the cluster
	#  as a whole.

		#  Maximum number of connections
		#
		#  If these connections are all in use and a new one
		#  is requested, the request will NOT get a connection.
		#
		#  Setting 'max' to LESS than the number of threads means
		#  that some threads may starve, and you will see errors
		#  like 'No connections available and at max connection limit'
		#
		#  Setting 'max' to MORE than the number of threads means
		#  that there are more connections than necessary.
		max = ${thread[pool].num_workers}

		#  NOTE: Idle connections WILL be closed if "idle_timeout"
		#  is set.  This should be less than or equal to "max" above.

		#  The number of seconds to wait after the server tries
		#  to open a connection, and fails.  During this time,
		#  no new connections will be opened.
		retry_delay = 30

		#  The lifetime (in seconds) of the connection
		#
		#  NOTE: A setting of 0 means infinite (no limit).
		lifetime = 86400

		#  The pool is checked for free connections every
		#  "cleanup_interval".  If there are free connections,
		#  then one of them is closed.
		cleanup_interval = 300

		#  The idle timeout (in seconds).  A connection which is
		#  unused for this length of time will be closed.

		#  Connection timeout (in seconds).  The maximum amount of
		#  time to wait for a new connection to be established.
		connect_timeout = 3.0

		#  NOTE: All configuration settings are enforced.  If a
		#  connection is closed because of "idle_timeout",
		#  "uses", or "lifetime", then the total number of
		#  connections MAY fall below "min".  When that
		#  happens, it will open a new connection.  It will
		#  also log a WARNING message.
		#
		#  The solution is to either lower the "min" connections,
		#  or increase lifetime/idle_timeout.

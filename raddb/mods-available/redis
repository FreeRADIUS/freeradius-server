#  = REDIS Module
#
#  The `redis` module handles connections to a redis database,
#  and the `%{redis: ...}` dynamic expansion.
#
#  See also https://redis.io/documentation for documentation on the
#  Redis database.
#

#
#  ## Configuration Settings
#
#  This module connects to a Redis database.  Other modules
#  (e.g. `redis_ippool`) perform task-specific functions using Redis.
#
redis {
	#
	#  server:: The server to connect to.
	#
	#  If using Redis cluster, multiple 'bootstrap' servers may be
	#  listed here (as separate config items). These will be contacted
	#  in turn until one provides us with a valid map for the cluster.
	#
	#  Server strings may contain unique ports e.g.:
	#
	#    server = '127.0.0.1:30001'
	#    server = '[::1]:30002'
	#
	#  NOTE: Instantiation failure behaviour is controlled by `pool.start`
	#  as with every other module, but with clustering, the `pool { ... }`
	#  section determines limits for each node in the cluster, not the
	#  cluster as a whole.
	#
	server = 127.0.0.1

	#  Select the Redis logical database having the specified zero-based numeric index.
#	database = 0

	#  The default port.
	port = 6379

	#  password:: The password used to authenticate to the server.
	#
	#  We recommend using a strong password.
	#
#	password = thisisreallysecretandhardtoguess

	#
	#  pool { ... }::
	#
	#  Information for the connection pool.  The configuration items below
	#  are the same for all modules which use the new connection pool.
	#
	pool {
		#
		#  start:: Connections to create during module instantiation.
		#  If the server cannot create specified number of connections
		#  during instantiation it will exit.
		#
		#  Set to `0` to allow the server to start without the web service
		#  being available.
		#
		start = ${thread[pool].num_workers}

		#
		#  min:: Minimum number of connections to keep open.
		#
		min = ${thread[pool].num_workers}

		#
		#  max:: Maximum number of connections.
		#
		#  If these connections are all in use and a new one
		#  is requested, the request will NOT get a connection.
		#
		#  Setting `max` to LESS than the number of threads means
		#  that some threads may starve, and you will see errors
		#  like 'No connections available and at max connection limit'
		#
		#  Setting `max` to MORE than the number of threads means
		#  that there are more connections than necessary.
		#
		max = ${thread[pool].num_workers}

		#
		#  spare:: Spare connections to be left idle.
		#
		#  NOTE: Idle connections WILL be closed if `idle_timeout`
		#  is set.  This should be less than or equal to `max` above.
		#
		spare = 1

		#
		#  uses:: Number of uses before the connection is closed.
		#
		#  NOTE: `0` means "infinite".
		#
		uses = 0

		#
		#  retry_delay:: The number of seconds to wait after the server tries
		#  to open a connection, and fails.
		#
		#  During this time, no new connections will be opened.
		#
		retry_delay = 30

		#
		#  lifetime:: The lifetime (in seconds) of the connection.
		#
		#  NOTE: `0` means "infinite".
		#
		lifetime = 86400

		#
		#  cleanup_interval:: The pool is checked for free connections every
		#  `cleanup_interval`.
		#
		#  If there are free connections, then one of them is closed.
		#
		cleanup_interval = 300

		#
		#  idle_timeout:: The idle timeout (in seconds).
		#
		#  A connection which is unused for this length of time will be closed.
		#
		#  NOTE: `0` means "infinite".
		#
		idle_timeout = 600

		#
		#  connect_timeout:: Connection timeout (in seconds).
		#
		#  The maximum amount of time to wait for a new connection to be established.
		#
		connect_timeout = 3.0

		#
		#  [NOTE]
		#  ====
		#  All configuration settings are enforced.  If a connection is closed because of
		#  `idle_timeout`, `uses`, or `lifetime`, then the total number of connections MAY
		#  fall below `min`.
		#
		#  When that happens, it will open a new connection.  It will also log a *WARNING*
		#  message.
		#
		#  The solution is to either lower the "min" connections,
		#  or increase lifetime/idle_timeout.

#  SMS One-time Password system.
#
#  This module will extend FreeRadius with a socks interface to create and
#  validate One-Time-Passwords. The program for that creates the socket
#  and interacts with this module is not included here.
# 
#  The module does not check the User-Password, this should be done with
#  the "pap" module.  See the example below.
#
#  The module must be used in the "authorize" section to set 
#  Auth-Type properly.  The first time through, the module is called
#  in the "authenticate" section to authenticate the user password, and
#  to send the challenge.  The second time through, it authenticates
#  the response to the challenge. e.g.:
#
#  authorize {
#	...
#	smsotp
#	...
#  }
#
#  authenticate {
#	...
#	Auth-Type smsotp {
#		pap
#		smsotp
#	}
#
#	Auth-Type smsotp-reply {
#		smsotp
#	}
#	...
#  }
#
smsotp {
	#  The location of the socket.
	socket = "/var/run/smsotp_socket"

	#  Defines the challenge message that will be send to the
	#  NAS. Default is "Enter Mobile PIN" }
	challenge_message = "Enter Mobile PIN:"

	#  Defines the Auth-Type section that is run for the response to
	#  the challenge. Default is "smsotp-reply".
	challenge_type = "smsotp-reply"
}

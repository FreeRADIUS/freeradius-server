#  = DHCPv4 Module
#

#
#  == Configuration Settings
#
#  The DHCPv4 module is used as a relay.
#
#  For reach request, you should set `control.Net.Dst.IP` and maybe
#  `control.Net.Dst.Port` to the address of the next DHCPv4 server or
#  relay.
#
#  Packets MUST also have a `Gateway-IP-Address` option, otherwise
#  they will be dropped.  This module does not (yet) support receiving
#  replies from the DHCPv4 server.  Any packets sent to the outgoing
#  socket will be discarded.
#
dhcpv4 {
	#
	#  ipaddr: The IP address we use for sending packets.
	#
	#  This MUST be an IPv4 address.  IPv6 addresses are not
	#  supported for DHCPv4.
	#
	ipaddr = 127.0.0.1

	#
	#  port:: The port we use for sending packets.
	#
	#  The default DHCPv4 client port is 68.  It should be changed
	#  from this only for testing.
	#
#	port = 68

	#
	#  interface:: Interface to bind to.
	#
#	interface = eth0

	#
	#  max_packet_size:: The maximum packet size.
	#
	#  Packets which are larger than this will not be sent.
	#
	#  Useful range: 300..1500 or so.
	#
#	max_packet_size = 576

	#
	#  send_buff:: How big the kernel's send buffer should be.
	#
#	send_buff = 1048576

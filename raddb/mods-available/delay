#  = Delay Module
#
#  The `delay` module delays the processing of a request in a
#  non-blocking fashion.
#
#  The module is most useful for rate limiting reject responses.
#  Instead of having a specific "reject delay" configuration, it is
#  instead possible to have a policy that delays the response.
#
#  TIP: The module can also be used to introduce artificial jitter into
#  responses by adding random delays.
#
#  == xlat for delays
#
#  The module also registers an xlat function for delays
#
#  %delay(...)
#
#  This function takes a time-delta argument (or data which is converted to a time-delta), and will delay the given number of seconds.
#
#  .Example
#
#  ```
#  %delay(0.2s)
#  ```

#

#
#  == Configuration Settings
#

#
#  === Simple delay
#
delay {
	#
	#  delay:: How long to delay request processing for.
	#
	delay = 1.0s

	#
	#  force_reschedule:: Whether the request should be rescheduled even if no
	#  delay is needed.
	#
	#  Rescheduling the request pauses it momentarily, and
	#  introduces a small delay.  It allows for processing of
	#  other requests ahead of this one.  The result is a small
	#  amount of "jitter" in responses, which can help avoid some
	#  deterministic timings in the network.
	#
#	force_reschedule = no

	#
	#  relative:: Whether delay should be calculated relative to when
	#  the request was received.
	#
	#  This configuration can be useful for rate limiting, as most
	#  NAS will only allow a limited number of requests to be in
	#  flight.
	#
	#  The default is `no`, which means that.
	#
#	relative = no

	#
	#  rcode:: Which rcode the delay module should return when it resumes
	#  this can be useful for detecting whether a `timeout { ... }` section
	#  expired, whilst the delay module was waiting.
	#
	#  The default is `notset`, which means that the delay module will be
	#  transparent and not alter the section rcode.
	#
	#  [NOTE]
	#  ====
	#  The default section `rcode` in many places is `fail`.  Care should be
	#  taken to set the `rcode` for the section a delay module appears in, if
	#  this configuration item is not set, and no other modules are present
	#  in the section.
	#  ====
	#
#	rcode = 'notset'
}

#
#  === Delaying Access-Reject packets
#
#  The `delay_reject` module should be used in a `send Access-Reject`
#  section, as the last module in that section. When `delay_reject`
#  is used there, the reject will be delayed for either
#  FreeRADIUS-Response-Delay seconds, or if that attribute does
#  not exist, then one second.
#
#  While the response is delayed, the server will continue processing
#  other requests.  It will simply set a timer to wake up and send the
#  response after the delay.
#
#  NOTE: We set `relative = yes` here.  That setting ensures that
#  if the server takes more than one second to process the request,
#  then the `delay_reject` module will not add *additional* delays.
#  Instead, this module will ensure that the `Access-Reject` is sent
#  no earlier than one second after the `Access-Request` had been
#  received.
#
delay delay_reject {
	delay = "%{reply.FreeRADIUS-Response-Delay || 1}"
	relative = yes
}

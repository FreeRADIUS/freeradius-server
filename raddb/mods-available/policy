#  Module implementing a DIFFERENT policy language.
#  The syntax here is NOT "unlang", but something else.

#  See the "raddb/policy.txt" file for documentation and examples.
#  There isn't much else in the way of documentation, sorry.

policy {
       #  The only configuration item is a filename containing
       #  the policies to execute.
       #
       #  When "policy" is listed in a section (e.g. "authorize"),
       #  it will run a policy named for that section.

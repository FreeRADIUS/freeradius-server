#  Sample configuration for an EAP module that occurs *inside*
#  of a tunneled method.  It is used to limit the EAP types that
#  can occur inside of the inner tunnel.
#
#  See also raddb/sites-available/inner-tunnel
#
#  See raddb/mods-available/eap for full documentation on the meaning of these
#  configuration entries.

	#  negotiated, but it's more efficient to offer the correct one the
	#  first time.

	#  TTLS   username/password    - gtc, mschapv2

	#
	#  The primary rationale for using PEAP-TLS or TTLS-TLS instead of
	#  EAP-TLS, is that it protects the certificate the user presents.
	#
	#  In the case of PEAP it also allows SoH with client certificates.

		#  OpenSSL will automatically create certificate chains, unless
		#  we tell it to not do that.  The problem is that it sometimes
		#  gets the chains right from a certificate signature view, but
		#  wrong from the clients view.
		#
		#  When setting "auto_chain = no", the server chain {} stanza(s)
		#  below MUST include the full certificate chain.
		#
#		auto_chain = yes

		#
		#  Multiple chain sections can be specified to allow
		#  different chains for different key types (RSA, DSA, EC).
		#
		#  If multiple chains for the same key type are specified
		#  the last chain to be processed will be used for that
		#  key type.

		#  Trusted Root CA list
		#
		#  ALL of the CA's in this list will be trusted to issue client
		#  certificates for authentication.
		#
		#  You should not use a public CA here.  This should either be
		#  set to a certificate chain for your institution's CA
		#  or a self signed Root CA.
		#

		#
		#  If your system doesn't have /dev/urandom, you will need to

		#
		#  As this is the inner tunnel, the fragment size is limited by
		#  the TLVs used to represent the inner EAP method.
		#
		#  For PEAPv0 and TTLS, the length field of these TLVs is 16bits.
		#
		#  The maximum TLS record size however is 16k, so that's what
		#  we set here.
		#
		#  This can be set lower for diagnostics, but will make EAP
		#  slightly less efficient, as there'll be additional header
		#  data in the inner tunnel.

	## EAP-TLS
	#
	#  You SHOULD use different certificates than are used
	#  for the outer EAP configuration!
	#
	#  You can create the "inner-server.pem" file by doing:
	#
	#       cd raddb/certs
	#       vi inner-server.cnf
	#       make inner-server
	#
	#  The certificate MUST be different from the "server.cnf"
	#  file.
	#
	#  Support for PEAP/TLS and RFC 5176 TLS/TLS is experimental.
	#  It might work, or it might not.

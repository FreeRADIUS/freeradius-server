#  = Radius Module
#
#  The `radius` module in v4, can be used to implement proxying and request
#  fan-out, as well as synchronous and asynchronous `CoA` and `DM`.
#
#  ## Configuration Settings
#
#  Any proxied packet (including `Accounting-Request`) can
#  receive a `Protocol-Error` response packet.  This packet
#  is an explicit `NAK` that something went wrong processing
#  the request.
#
#  WARNING: For security reasons, the module ensures that all proxied
#  `Access-Request` packets contain a `Message-Authenticator` attribute.
#  This behavior is *NOT* configurable, and *CANNOT* be changed.
#
#  The module adds a Proxy-State attribute to all proxied packets.
#  This `Proxy-State` contains a 32-bit random number, which is unique
#  to this module.  This unique number helps to detect proxy loops.
#
#  The module has the following return codes:
#
#  [options="header,autowidth"]
#  |===
#  | Code        | Description
#  | invalid     | Something went wrong sending the request,
#                  or the reply packet is invalid.
#  | ok          | the module received an `ack` (`Access-Accept`,
#                  `Accounting-Response`, `CoA-ACK`, etc.)
#  | handled     | the module received an `Access-Challenge`
#  | fail        | there was no response to the proxied request
#  | reject      | the module received a `nak` (`Access-Reject`, `CoA-NAK`, etc.)
#  | noop        | the module saw its own `Proxy-State` attribute,
#                  and is will not proxy the request.  This behavior
#                  prevents proxy loops.
#  |===

	#  transport:: Only UDP transport is allowed.
	#
	transport = udp

	#
	#  max_attributes:: Maximum number of attributes to decode in response.
	#
	#  Default is 255.
	#
#	max_attributes = 255

	#
	#  type:: List of allowed packet types.
	#
	#  There is currently no way to change the packet type in the
	#  request.  See `unlang` fork for that functionality.
	#
	#  NOTE: `Status-Server` is reserved for `inter-server` signaling,
	#  and cannot be proxied.
	#
	type = Access-Request
	type = Accounting-Request

	#
	#  replicate:: Whether or not we are replicating packets.
	#
	#  Replication is "send proxied request, and continue,
	#  without waiting for a response".  Any response received
	#  is discarded, and does not affect packet processing.
	#
#	replicate = no

	#
	#  synchronous::
	#
	#  In many cases, the module should do retransmissions of
	#  proxied request on its own.  See the various
	#  configurations for `initial_retransmission_time`,
	#  etc. below.  This means setting `synchronous = no`.
	#
	#  However, in some cases, it is useful to retransmit only
	#  when the server receives a retransmission from the NAS.
	#  This is done by setting `synchronous = yes`
	#
	#  In general, if the server is receiving packets directly
	#  from a NAS, you should set `synchronous = no`.  This is
	#  because the NAS retransmission behavior is horrible,
	#  inconsistent, and hard to configure.
	#
	#  If the server is receiving packets from another proxy
	#  server, you should set `synchronous = yes`.  This allows
	#  the other proxy server to do retransmissions correctly.
	#
	#  NOTE: The behavior in v3 is the same as `synchronous = yes`
	#
#	synchronous = no

	#
	#  no_connection_fail:: If no connections are available, then
	#  the module will immediately return "fail".
	#
#	no_connection_fail = no

	#
	#  originate:: Whether or not we are creating the packet.
	#
	#  Sometimes we are creating a request that is not for the purpose of
	#  proxying another request, in which case we do not want to add a
	#  Proxy-State attribute.
	#
	#  In some cases, such as originating a CoA or Disconnect request,
	#  including Proxy-State may confuse the receiving NAS.
#	originate = no

	#
	#  status_checks { ... }:: For "are you alive?" queries.
	#
	#  If the home server does not respond to proxied packets, the
	#  module starts pinging the home server with these packets.
	#
	status_checks {
		#
		#  type:: You can specify any type of packet here, though
		#  Status-Server is recommended.
		#
		#  If you specify another type of packet, it MUST be listed
		#  as an allowed `type`, above.
		#
		type = Status-Server

		#
		#  update request { ... }::
		#
		#  `Status-Server` packet contents are fixed and cannot
		#  be edited.
		#
		#  For other packet types, you can create the contents
		#  here.  The section MUST be "update request", and
		#  anything else will cause a parse error.
		#
		#  We RECOMMEND that you use packet contents which
		#  lets the other end easily tell that they are not
		#  "real" packets from a NAS.
		#
		#  The example here is for Access-Request.  The
		#  contents will vary by other packet types.
		#
		#  The module will automatically update the contents
		#  of the Event-Timestamp attribute to be the time
		#  when the packet is sent.  The module will also
		#  automatically add a Proxy-State attribute.
		#
		#  WARNING: Do NOT do SQL queries, LDAP queries, dynamic
		#  expansions, etc. in this section.  The contents are
		#  created when a connection is opened, and are not
		#  changeable after that.
		#
#		update request {
#			&User-Name := "test-user"
#			&User-Password := "this-is-not-a-real-password"
#			&NAS-Identifier := "Status check.  Are you alive?"

	#  zombie_period:: If the home server does not reply to a packet, the
	#  `zombie_period` starts.
	#
	#  The connection is marked `zombie`, and isn't used to send new packets.
	#  If there are no responses within `zombie_period`, the server either
	#  closes the connection (no `status_check`), or starts pinging the
	#  home server (`status_check = Status-Server`).

	zombie_period = 10

	#
	#  ## Connection trunking
	#
	#  Each worker thread (see radiusd.conf, num_workers), has
	#  it's own set of connections.  These connections are grouped
	#  together into a "trunk".
	#
	#  Much of the configuration here is similar to the old
	#  connection "pool" configuration in v3.  However, there are
	#  more configuration parameters, and therefore more control
	#  over the behavior.

		#
		#  After `lifetime` seconds have passed, no new
		#  packets will be sent on the connection.  When all
		#  replies have been received, the connection will be
		#  closed.
		#
		#  For no limits, set `lifetime = 0`.
		#
		#  It is possible to use precise times, such as
		#  `lifetime = 1.023`, or even qualifiers such as
		#  `lifetime = 400ms`.

		#
		#  open_delay:: How long (in seconds) a connection

#  Sample configuration for an EAP module that occurs *inside*
#  of a tunneled method.  It is used to limit the EAP types that
#  can occur inside of the inner tunnel.
#
#  See also raddb/sites-available/inner-tunnel
#
#  See raddb/mods-available/eap for full documentation on the meaning of these
#  configuration entries.

	## EAP-TLS
	#
	#  You SHOULD use different certificates than are used
	#  for the outer EAP configuration!

	#  Support for PEAP/TLS and RFC 5176 TLS/TLS is experimental.
	#  It might work, or it might not.

		#  If Private key & Certificate are located in
		#  the same file, then private_key_file &
		#  certificate_file must contain the same file
		#  name.
		#
		#  If ca_file (below) is not used, then the
		#  certificate_file below MUST include not
		#  only the server certificate, but ALSO all
		#  of the CA certificates used to sign the
		#  server certificate.

#  Set an account to expire T seconds after first login.
#  Requires the Expire-After attribute to be set, in seconds.
#  You may need to edit raddb/dictionary to add the Expire-After
#  attribute.
#
#  This example is for MySQL.  Other SQL variants should be similar.
#
#  For versions prior to 2.1.11, this module defined the following
#  expansion strings:
#
#	%k	key_name
#	%S	sqlmod_inst
#
#  These SHOULD NOT be used.  If these are used in your configuration,
#  they should be replaced by the following strings, which will work
#  identically to the previous ones:
#
#	%k	${key}
#	%S	${sqlmod-inst}
#
sqlcounter expire_on_login {
	counter-name = Expire-After-Initial-Login
	check-name = Expire-After
	sqlmod-inst = sql
	key = User-Name
	reset = never
	query = "SELECT TIME_TO_SEC(TIMEDIFF(NOW(), acctstarttime)) \
		 FROM radacct \
		 WHERE UserName='%{${key}}' \
		 ORDER BY acctstarttime \
		 LIMIT 1;"
}

#  = Attr_filter Module
#
#  The `attr_filter` module exists for filtering certain attributes and
#  values in received (or transmitted) radius  packets. It gives the
#  server a flexible framework to filter the attributes we send to or
#  receive from home servers or NASes. This makes sense, for example,
#  in an  out-sourced  dialup  situation to various policy decisions, such as
#  restricting a client to certain ranges of `Idle-Timeout` or `Session-Time-out`.
#
#  Filter rules are normally defined and applied on a per-realm basis, Filter
#  rules can optionally be applied using another attribute, by editing the key
#  configuration for this module.
#
#  The rules for each entry are parsed to top to bottom, and an attribute
#  must pass *all* the rules which affect it in order to make it past the filter.
#  Order of the rules is important.
#  The operators and their purpose in defining the rules are as follows:
#
#  [options="header", cols="10%,90%"]
#  |===
#  | Operator | Description
#  | =        | THIS OPERATOR IS NOT ALLOWED. If used, and warning message is
#               printed and it is treated as *==*.
#  | :=       | Set, this attribute and value will always be placed in the
#               output A/V Pairs. If the attribute exists, it is overwritten.
#  | ==       | Equal, value must match exactly.
#  | =*       | Always Equal, allow all values for the specified attribute.
#  | !*       | Never Equal, disallow all values for the specified attribute.
#               (This is redundant, as any A/V Pair not explicitly permitted
#               will be dropped).
#  | !=       | Not Equal, value must not match.
#  | >=       | Greater Than or Equal.
#  | <=       | Less Than or Equal.
#  | >        | Greater Than.
#  | <        | Less Than.
#  |===
#
#  If regular expressions are enabled the following operators are also possible.
#  (Regular Expressions are included by default unless your system doesn't support
#  them, which should be rare). The value field uses standard regular expression syntax.
#
#  [options="header", cols="10%,90%"]
#  |===
#  | Operator | Description
#  | =~       | Regular Expression Equal
#  | !~       | Regular Expression Not Equal
#  |===
#
#  ## Syntax
#
#  The configuration items are:
#
#attr_filter attr_filter.<section> {
	#
	#  key:: The `key` to use for filter the packets.
	#
#	key = "<value>"

	#
	#  filename:: The `filename` with the attributes to filter.
	#
#	filename = </path/><section>
#}

#
#  ## Configuration Settings
#
#  The following default instances.
#

#
#  ### pre-proxy
#
#  Filters the attributes in the packets we send to
#  the RADIUS home servers.
#
#  Add this before calling rlm_radius for proxying.
#
attr_filter attr_filter.pre-proxy {
	key = "%{Realm}"
	filename = ${modconfdir}/${.:name}/pre-proxy
}

#
#  ### post-proxy
#
#  Filters the attributes received in replies from proxied
#  servers, to make sure we send back to our RADIUS client
#  only allowed attributes.
#
#  Add this after calling `rlm_radius` for proxying.
#
attr_filter attr_filter.post-proxy {
	key = "%{Realm}"
	filename = ${modconfdir}/${.:name}/post-proxy
}

#
#  ### access_reject
#
#  Enforce RFC requirements on the contents of `Access-Reject`
#  packets. This should be called from `send Access-Reject`.
#
attr_filter attr_filter.access_reject {
	key = "%{User-Name}"
	filename = ${modconfdir}/${.:name}/access_reject
}

#
#  ### access_challenge
#
#  Enforce RFC requirements on the contents of `Access-Challenge`
#  packets. This is called from `send Access-Challenge`.
#
attr_filter attr_filter.access_challenge {
	key = "%{User-Name}"
	filename = ${modconfdir}/${.:name}/access_challenge
}

#
#  ### accounting_response
#
#  Enforce RFC requirements on the contents of the
#  `Accounting-Response` packets. Called from the
#  `send Accounting-Response` section.
#
attr_filter attr_filter.accounting_response {
	key = "%{User-Name}"
	filename = ${modconfdir}/${.:name}/accounting_response
}

#  The "always" module is here for debugging purposes, or
#  for use in complex policies.
#  Instance simply returns the same result, always, without
#  doing anything.
#
#  rcode may be one of the following values:
#  - reject   - Reject the user.
#  - fail     - Simulate or indicate a failure.
#  - ok       - Simulate or indicate a success.
#  - handled  - Indicate that the request has been handled,
#               stop processing, and send response if set.
#  - invalid  - Indicate that the request is invalid.
#  - userlock - Indicate that the user account has been
#               locked out.
#  - notfound - Indicate that a user account can't be found.
#  - noop     - Simulate a no-op.
#  - updated  - Indicate that the request has been updated.
#
#  If an instance is listed in a session {}  section, 
#  this simulates a user having <integer> sessions.
#  
#  simulcount = <integer>
#
#  If an instance is listed in a session {}  section, 
#  this simulates the user having multilink
#  sessions.
#
#  mpp = <integer>

#  = Always Module
#
#  The `always` module simply returns the same result, always, without
#  doing anything else.  It is here for use in complex policies.
#
#  The main configuration item is `rcode`, which sets the return  code that
#  this  instantiation  of  the  module  will return. The default, if none
#  specified, is 'fail'.
#

#
#  ## Syntax
#
#always <name> {
	#
	#  rcode:: Return code.
	#
	#  The `rcode` may be one of the following values:
	#
	#  [options="header,autowidth"]
	#  |===
	#  | Parameter  | Description
	#  | `reject`   | Reject the user.
	#  | `fail`     | Simulate or indicate a failure.
	#  | `ok`       | Simulate or indicate a success.
	#  | `handled`  | Indicate that the request has been handled,
	#                 stop processing, and send response if set.
	#  | `invalid`  | Indicate that the request is invalid.
	#  | `userlock` | Indicate that the user account has been
	#                 locked out.
	#  | `notfound` | Indicate that a user account can't be found.
	#  | `noop`     | Simulate a no-op.
	#  | `updated`  | Indicate that the request has been updated.
	#  |===
	#
#	rcode = <value>

	#
	#  simulcount::
	#
	#  If an instance of this module is listed in a `session {}`
	#  section, this simulates a user having `<integer>` number of sessions.
	#
#	simulcount = <integer>

	#
	#  mpp::
	#
	#  If an instance is listed in a `session {}` section, this
	#  simulates the user having multilink sessions.
	#
#	mpp = <integer>
#}

#
#  ## Default Instance
#
#  The following default instances allow the use of return codes like
#  `reject` or `ok` in `unlang` policies.
#
always reject {
	rcode = reject
}
always fail {
	rcode = fail
}
always ok {
	rcode = ok
}
always handled {
	rcode = handled
}
always invalid {
	rcode = invalid
}
always userlock {
	rcode = userlock
}
always notfound {
	rcode = notfound
}
always noop {
	rcode = noop
}
always updated {
	rcode = updated
}

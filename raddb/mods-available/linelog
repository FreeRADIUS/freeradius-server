		#  - cron        The cron daemon: cron(8).
		#  - authpriv    The same as LOG_AUTH, but logged to a file
		#                readable only by selected individuals.
		#  - ftp         The file transfer protocol daemons: ftpd(8),

		#  - local[0-7]  Reserved for local use.

		#  - alert       A condition that should be corrected immediately,
		#                such as a corrupted system database.
		#  - critical    Critical conditions, e.g., hard device errors.
		#  - error       Errors.
		#  - warning     Warning messages.
		#  - notice      Conditions that are not error conditions, but
		#                should possibly be handled specially.
		#  - info        Informational messages.

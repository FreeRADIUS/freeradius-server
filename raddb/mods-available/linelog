	#  and the result is used to find another configuration entry
	#  here, with the given name.  That name is then used as the
	#  format string.
	#
	#  If the configuration entry cannot be found, then no log
	#  message is printed.
	#
	#  i.e. You can have many log messages in one "linelog" module.
	#  If this two-step expansion did not exist, you would have
	#  needed to configure one "linelog" module for each log message.

	#  exist, reference the "format" entry, above.

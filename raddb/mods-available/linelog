	#  Syslog facility (if logging via syslog).
	#  Defaults to the syslog_facility config item in radiusd.conf.
	#  Standard facilities are:
	#  - kern        Messages generated by the kernel.  These cannot
	#                be generated by any user processes.
	#  - user        Messages generated by random user processes.
	#                This is the default facility identifier if
	#                none is specified.
	#  - mail        The mail system.
	#  - daemon      System daemons, such as routed(8), that are not
	#                provided for explicitly by other facilities.
	#  - auth        The authorization system: login(1), su(1),
	#                getty(8), etc.
	#  - lpr         The line printer spooling system: cups-lpd(8),
	#                cupsd(8), etc.
	#  - news        The network news system.
	#  - uucp        The uucp system.
	#  - cron        The cron daemon: cron(8).
	#  - authpriv    The same as LOG_AUTH, but logged to a file
	#                readable only by selected individuals.
	#  - ftp         The file transfer protocol daemons: ftpd(8),
	#                tftpd(8).
	#  - local[0-7]  Reserved for local use.

	#  Syslog severity (if logging via syslog). Defaults to info.
	#  Possible values are:
	#  - emergency   A panic condition.  This is normally broadcast
	#                to all users.
	#  - alert       A condition that should be corrected immediately,
	#                such as a corrupted system database.
	#  - critical    Critical conditions, e.g., hard device errors.
	#  - error       Errors.
	#  - warning     Warning messages.
	#  - notice      Conditions that are not error conditions, but
	#                should possibly be handled specially.
	#  - info        Informational messages.
	#  - debug       Messages that contain information normally of use
	#                only when debugging a program.
#	syslog_severity = info

	#  If logging via syslog, the severity can be set here.
	#  Defaults to info.

	#  The default format string.
	format = "This is a log message for %{User-Name}"

	#
	#  This next line can be omitted.  If it is omitted, then
	#  the log message is static, and is always given by "format",
	#  above.
	#
	#  If it is defined, then the string is dynamically expanded,
	#  and the result is used to find another configuration entry
	#  here, with the given name.  That name is then used as the
	#  format string.
	#
	#  If the configuration entry cannot be found, then no log
	#  message is printed.
	#
	#  i.e. You can have many log messages in one "linelog" module.
	#  If this two-step expansion did not exist, you would have
	#  needed to configure one "linelog" module for each log message.

	#
	#  Reference the Packet-Type (Access-Accept, etc.)  If it doesn't
	#  exist, reference the "defaukt" entry.
	#
	#  This is for "linelog" being used in the post-auth section
	#  If you want to use it in "authorize", you need to change
	#  the reference to "messages.%{%{Packet-Type}:-default}",
	#  and then add the appropriate messages.
	#
	reference = "messages.%{%{reply:Packet-Type}:-default}"

	#
	#  The messages defined here are taken from the "reference"
	#  expansion, above.
	#
	messages {
		default = "Unknown packet type %{Packet-Type}"

		Access-Accept = "Accepted user: %{User-Name}"
		Access-Reject = "Rejected user: %{User-Name}"
		Access-Challenge = "Sent challenge: %{User-Name}"

	#  Used if the expansion of "reference" fails.

#  = Linelog Module
#
#  The `linelog` module will log entries from attributes, string expansions,
#  or static strings, and writes them to a variety of backends, including syslog,
#  flat files, and raw UDP/TCP sockets.
#
#  NOTE: Multiple linelog's modules may be used for any given request.
#  The `logtee` modules will not affect normal logging output.
#  i.e. This logging is *in addition* to any other logging that is
#  done by the server.
#

#
#  ## Configuration Settings
#
linelog {
	#
	#  delimiter::  Custom line delimiters.
	#
	#  Defaults to `\n` (newline) but may be any UTF8 multi-character
	#  string.
	#
#	delimiter = "\n"

	#
	#  format:: The default format string. May be an attribute reference.
	#
	#  e.g. `&User-Name`, or `xlat`, `literal` or `exec`.
	#
	format = "This is a log message for %{User-Name}"

	#
	#  [NOTE]
	#  ====
	#  The `reference` configuration item can be omitted.  If it
	#  is omitted, then the log message is static, and is always
	#  given by `format`, above.
	#
	#  If `reference` is defined, then the value is dynamically
	#  expanded, and the result is used to find another
	#  configuration entry here, with the given name.  That name
	#  is then used as the format string.
	#
	#  If the configuration entry cannot be found, then no log
	#  message is printed.
	#
	#  i.e: You can have many log messages in one `linelog` module.
	#  If this two-step expansion did not exist, you would have
	#  needed to configure one `linelog` module for each log message.
	#  ====
	#

	#
	#  reference::
	#
	#  Reference the `Packet-Type` (`Access-Request`, etc.)  If
	#  `reference` is commented out, the `format` entry above is
	#  used instead.
	#
	#  May be an attribute reference, e.g. `&User-Name`, or `xlat`, `literal` or `exec`.
	#
	reference = "messages.%{%{reply:Packet-Type}:-default}"

	#
	#  messages { ... }::
	#
	#  The messages defined here are chosen from the `reference`
	#  expansion, above.
	#
	#  Pairs may be attributes attribute reference `&User-Name` , `xlat`, `literal` or `exec`.
	#
	messages {
		default = "Unknown packet type %{Packet-Type}"

		Access-Accept = "Sent accept: %{User-Name}"
		Access-Reject = "Sent reject: %{User-Name}"
		Access-Challenge = "Sent challenge: %{User-Name}"

	#  | file   | Write to a file.

		#  file system!  If it is necessary you must set
		#  `escape_filenames = yes` in order to prevent
		#  security issues.
		#
		filename = ${logdir}/linelog

		#
		#  permissions:: The Unix-style permissions on the log file.
		#
		#  Depending on format string, the log file may contain secret or
		#  private information about users.  Keep the file permissions as
		#  restrictive as possible.
		#
		permissions = 0600

		#
		#  group:: The Unix group which owns the log file.
		#
		#  The user that freeradius runs as must be in the specified
		#  group, otherwise it will not be possible to set the group.
		#
#		group = ${security.group}

		#
		#  Setting `max` to LESS than the number of threads means
		#  that some threads may starve, and you will see errors
		#  like 'No connections available and at `max` connection limit'
		#
		#  Setting `max` to MORE than the number of threads means
		#  that there are more connections than necessary.

		#  to open a connection, and fails.  During this time,
		#  no new connections will be opened.

		#
		#  idle_timeout:: A connection which is unused for this length
		#  of time will be closed.
		#
		#  Default `60` seconds.
		#
		idle_timeout = 60

		#
		#  held_trigger_min:: If a connection is held for less than the specified
		#  period, fire a trigger.
		#
#		held_trigger_min = 0

		#
		#  held_trigger_max:: If a connection is held for longer than the specified
		#  period, fire a trigger.
		#
#		held_trigger_max = 0.5

		#
		#  max_pending:: Max number of pending connections to allow.
		#
#		max_pending = 0

		#
		#  NOTE: All configuration settings are enforced.  If a
		#  connection is closed because of `idle_timeout`,
		#  `uses`, or `lifetime`, then the total number of
		#  connections MAY fall below `min`.  When that
		#  happens, it will open a new connection.  It will
		#  also log a WARNING message.
		#
		#  The solution is to either lower the `min` connections,
		#  or increase `lifetime`/`idle_timeout`.

#  = isc_dhcp Module
#
#  The `isc_dhcp` module reads ISC DHCP configuration files.
#
#  When the module is listed in the `recv DHCP-Discover` section, as
#  "isc_dhcp.authorize" (sorry), it will look up the client by
#  `client-identifier`, or failing that, `hardware ethernet`.  If
#  found, the module will apply a `fixed-address` option to assign an
#  IP address.
#
#  Leases are *not* handled by this module.  Instead, you should use
#  an "ip pool" module in the `send DHCP-Offer" section.  Then after
#  an IP address has been allocated, list `isc_dhcp` (without the
#  `authorize`).
#
#  The module will then apply any matching options to the packet.
#

#
#  ## Configuration Settings
#
isc_dhcp {
	#
	#  moddir:: Search for files in a subdirectory of mods-config which
	#  matches this instance of the files module.
	#
	moddir = ${modconfdir}/${.:instance}

	#
	#  filename:: The ISC DHCP configuration file
	#
	filename = ${moddir}/dhcpd.conf

	#
	#  debug:: For developers, we print out what we're parsing.
	#
	debug = true

	#
	#  pedantic:: Be harsh or forgiving about what we parse
	#
	#  The `isc_dhcp` module implements only a small subset of the
	#  ISC DHCP configuration file commands.  However, the module
	#  *parses* just about everything that is allowable in the ISC
	#  DHCP configuration.
	#
	#  The goal here is to allow an easy migration from ISC DHCP
	#  to FreeRADIUS, by just copying over "dhcpd.conf".
	#  FreeRADIUS will at least start, instead of complaining
	#  about everything.
	#
	#  If `pedantic = true`, then the module will fail with an
	#  error when it sees a command it knows it can't implement.
	#  The module will also issue warnings for commands which are
	#  ignored (e.g. OMAPI ones, "listen on port X", and similar).
	#  The module will also issue warnings for commands which
	#  should be implemented at some point.
	#
	#  If a command does not produce any errors or warnings, it is
	#  implemented and supported.
	#
	#  The default is `pedantic = false`
	#
#	pedantic = true

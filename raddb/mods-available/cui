#  = CUI Module
#
#  The module `cui` (`Chargeable-User-Identity`) writes
#  `Chargeable-User-Identity` log to an SQL database.   It uses the `sql`
#  module to do the bulk of the work, but has custom schemas and
#  queries.
#
#  * Schema is in `raddb/sql/cui/<DB>/schema.sql`
#  * Queries are in `raddb/sql/cui/<DB>/queries.conf`
#

#
#  ## Configuration Settingss
#
sql cuisql {
	#
	#  dialect:: The dialect of SQL you want to use, this should usually match
	#  the driver below.
	#
	#  NOTE: If you're using rlm_sql_null, then it should be the type of
	#  database the logged queries are going to be executed against.
	#
	dialect = "sqlite"

	#
	#  driver:: The sub-module to use to execute queries. This should match
	#  the database you're attempting to connect to.
	#
	#  There are CUI queries available for:
	#
	#  [options="header,autowidth"]
	#  |===
	#  | DB          | Driver
	#  | SQLite      | rlm_sql_sqlite
	#  | MySQL       | rlm_sql_mysql
	#  | PostgreSQL  | rlm_sql_postgresql
	#  | Log to disk | rlm_sql_null
	#  |===
	#
	driver = "rlm_sql_${dialect}"

	#
	#  [NOTE]
	#  ====
	#  For dialect `mysql` and `postgresql` the following information should be provided:
	#
#	server = "localhost"
#	port = 3306
#	login = "radius"
#	password = "radpass"
#	radius_db = "radius"
	#  ====

	#
	#  sqlite { ... }:: SQLite configuration.
	#
	sqlite {
		filename = ${radacctdir}/cui.sqlite
		bootstrap = ${modconfdir}/${..:name}/cui/sqlite/schema.sql

	#
	#  logfile:: Write CUI queries to a logfile. Useful for debugging.
	#
#	logfile = ${logdir}/cuilog.sql

	#
	#  pool { ... }:: persistent connections to external resources.
	#

	#
	#  cui_table:: The name of the database table to use for store.
	#
	cui_table = "cui"

	#
	#  sql_user_name:: `SQL-User-Name` is used as the user for SQL queries.
	#  Normally it is the same as `User-Name`, but sometimes it needs to be different.
	#  Then instead of editing `User-Name` (*which we dont' recommend*), you can
	#  set `SQL-User-Name` to the new value.
	#
	sql_user_name = "%{User-Name}"

	#
	#  .Load the queries from a separate file.

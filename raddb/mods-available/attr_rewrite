#  rewrite arbitrary packets.  Useful in accounting and authorization.
#
#  As of 2.0, much of the functionality of this module is in "unlang".
#  You should probably investigate using that before trying to use
#  the "attr_rewrite" module.
#
#
#  The module can also use the Rewrite-Rule attribute. If it
#  is set and matches the name of the module instance, then
#  that module instance will be the only one which runs.
#
#  Also if new_attribute is set to yes then a new attribute
#  will be created containing the value replacewith and it
#  will be added to searchin (packet, reply, proxy,
#  proxy_reply or config).
#
# searchfor,ignore_case and max_matches will be ignored in that case.
#
# Backreferences are supported.
#	%{0} will contain the string the whole match
#	%{1} to %{8} will contain the contents of the 1st to
#	the 8th parentheses
#
# If max_matches is greater than one, the backreferences will
# correspond to the first attributed that matched.

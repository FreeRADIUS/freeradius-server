#  = Templates
#
#  Templates are configurations that can be used in multiple places.
#
#  Use templates by adding a line in radiusd.conf:
#
#      $INCLUDE templates.conf
#
#  The goal of the templates is to have common configuration located
#  in this file, and to list only the _differences_ in the individual
#  sections.  This feature is most useful for sections like `clients`
#  where many may be defined, and each one has similar repeated
#  configuration.
#
#  Something similar to templates can be done by putting common
#  configuration into separate files, and using `$INCLUDE file...`,
#  but templates are more flexible, and simpler to understand.  It's also
#  cheaper for the server, because `$INCLUDE` makes a copy of the
#  configuration for inclusion, whereas templates are simply referenced.
#
#  The templates are defined in the `templates` section so that
#  they do not affect the rest of the server configuration. The
#  actual contents of the templates section are other
#  configuration sections that would normally go into the main
#  configuration files.
#
#  Within the main server configuration, a section can reference a
#  template by using `$template name`.
#
#  For now, you can use templates only for sections in
#  radiusd.conf, not sub-sections.  So you still have to use the
#  `$INCLUDE file...` method for things like defining multiple
#  "sql" modules, each with similar configuration.
#

#
#  ## Template example
#
#  Define the main template section:
#
templates {
	#
	#  Unlike v3, Access-Request log configuration is different
	#  for each `listen` section.  Templates can be used to regain
	#  a global configuration.  Simply configure the following
	#  section as you like, and then in every Access-Request
	#  subsection, put:
	#
	#      Access-Request {
	#          $template Access-Request
	#      }
	#
	#  then enable `templates.conf` as described above.
	#
	Access-Request {
		#
		#  stripped_names:: Log the full User-Name
		#  attribute, as it was found in the request.
		#
		#  Allowed values: {no, yes}
		#
		stripped_names = no

		#
		#  auth:: Log authentication requests to the log file.
		#
		#  Allowed values: {no, yes}
		#
		auth = no

		#
		#  Should we log passwords with the authentication requests?
		#
		#  auth_badpass:: logs password if it's rejected
		#  auth_goodpass:: logs password if it's correct
		#
		#  Allowed values: {no, yes}
		#
		auth_badpass = no
		auth_goodpass = no

		#
		#  Log additional text at the end of the "Login OK" messages.
		#  for these to work, the "auth" and "auth_goodpass" or "auth_badpass"
		#  configurations above have to be set to "yes".
		#
		#  The strings below are dynamically expanded, which means that
		#  you can put anything you want in them.  However, note that
		#  this expansion can be slow, and can negatively impact server
		#  performance.
		#
		#  msg_goodpass:: text to log after a correct password
		#  msg_badpass:: text to log after an incorrect password
		#
		msg_goodpass = ""
		msg_badpass = ""

		#
		#  msg_denied:: The message when the user exceeds
		#  the Simultaneous-Use limit.
		#
		msg_denied = "You are already logged in - access denied"
	}
}

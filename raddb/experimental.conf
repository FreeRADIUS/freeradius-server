	# Where radiusd is a Python module, radiusd.py, and the
	# function 'authorize' is called.  Here is a dummy piece
	# of code:
	# 
	#	def authorize(params):
	#	    print params
	#	    return (5, ('Reply-Message', 'banned'))
	#
	# The RADIUS value-pairs are passed as a tuple of tuple
	# pairs as the first argument, e.g. (('attribute1',
	# 'value1'), ('attribute2', 'value2'))
	#
	# The function return is a tuple with the first element
	# being the return value of the function.
	# The 5 corresponds to RLM_MODULE_USERLOCK. I plan to
	# write the return values as Python symbols to avoid
	# confusion.
	#
	# The remaining tuple members are the string form of
	# value-pairs which are passed on to pairmake().
	#

	#  you may have to specify it here without that extension.  This

	# Another implementation of the EAP module.
	#
	#  This module requires the libeap.so file from the hostap
	#  software (http://hostap.epitest.fi/hostapd/).  It has been
	#  tested on the development version of hostapd (0.6.1) ONLY.
	#
	#  In order to use it, you MUST build a "libeap.so" in hostapd,
	#  which is not done by default.
	#
	#  You MUST also edit the file: src/modules/rlm_eap2/Makefile
	#  to point to the location of the hostap include files.
	#
	#  This module CANNOT be used in the same way as the current
	#  FreeRADIUS "eap" module.  There is NO way to look inside of
	#  a tunneled request.  There is NO way to proxy a tunneled
	#  request.  There is NO way to even look at the user name inside
	#  of the tunneled request.  There is NO way to control the
	#  choice of EAP types inside of the tunnel.  You MUST force
	#  the server to choose "eap2" for authentication, because this
	#  module has no "authorize" section.
	#
	#  If you want to use this module for experimentation, please
	#  post your comments to the freeradius-devel list:
	#
	#    http://lists.freeradius.org/mailman/listinfo/freeradius-devel
	#
	#  If you want to use this module in a production (i.e. real-world)
	#  environment:
	#
	#	!!! DO NOT USE IT IN A PRODUCTION ENVIRONMENT !!!
	#
	#  The module needs additional work to make it ready for
	#  production use..  Please supply patches, or sponsor the
	#  work by hiring a developer.  Do NOT ask when the work will
	#  be done, because there is no plan to finish this module
	#  unless there is demand for it.

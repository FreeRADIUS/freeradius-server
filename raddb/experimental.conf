	# Where radiusd is a Python module, radiusd.py, and the
	# function 'authorize' is called.  Here is a dummy piece
	# of code:
	# 
	#	def authorize(params):
	#	    print params
	#	    return (5, ('Reply-Message', 'banned'))
	#
	# The RADIUS value-pairs are passed as a tuple of tuple
	# pairs as the first argument, e.g. (('attribute1',
	# 'value1'), ('attribute2', 'value2'))
	#
	# The function return is a tuple with the first element
	# being the return value of the function.
	# The 5 corresponds to RLM_MODULE_USERLOCK. I plan to
	# write the return values as Python symbols to avoid
	# confusion.
	#
	# The remaining tuple members are the string form of
	# value-pairs which are passed on to pairmake().
	#

	#  This module is an SQL enabled version of the counter module.
	#  
	#  Rather than maintaining seperate (GDBM) databases of
	#  accounting info for each counter, this module uses the data
	#  stored in the raddacct table by the sql modules. This
	#  module NEVER does any database INSERTs or UPDATEs.  It is
	#  totally dependent on the SQL module to process Accounting
	#  packets.
	#
	#  The 'sqlmod_inst' parameter holds the instance of the sql
	#  module to use when querying the SQL database. Normally it
	#  is just "sql".  If you define more and one SQL module
	#  instance (usually for failover situations), you can
	#  specify which module has access to the Accounting Data
	#  (radacct table).
	#
	#  The 'reset' parameter defines when the counters are all
	#  reset to zero.  It can be hourly, daily, weekly, monthly or
	#  never.  It can also be user defined. It should be of the
	#  form:
	#  	num[hdwm] where:
	#  	h: hours, d: days, w: weeks, m: months
	#  	If the letter is ommited days will be assumed. In example:
	#  	reset = 10h (reset every 10 hours)
	#  	reset = 12  (reset every 12 days)
	#
	#  The 'key' parameter specifies the unique identifier for the
	#  counter records (usually 'User-Name').
	#
	#  The 'query' parameter specifies the SQL query used to get
	#  the current Counter value from the database. There are 3
	#  parameters that can be used in the query:
	#		%k	'key' parameter
	#		%b	unix time value of beginning of reset period 
	#		%e	unix time value of end of reset period
	#
	#
	#  The 'check-name' parameter is the name of the 'check'
	#  attribute to use to access the counter in the 'users' file
	#  or SQL radcheck or radcheckgroup tables.
	#
	#  DEFAULT  Max-Daily-Session > 3600, Auth-Type = Reject

		# This query is the same as above, but demonstrates an
		# additional counter parameter '%e' which is the

	#  Do server side ip pool management. Should be added in post-auth and
	#  accounting sections.
	#
	##  This module is highly experimental at the moment. Please
	##  give feedback on the mailing list.
	#
	#  The module also requires the existance of the Pool-Name
	#  attribute. That way the administrator can add the Pool-Name
	#  attribute in the user profiles and use different pools
	#  for different users. The Pool-Name attribute is a *check* item not
	#  a reply item.
	#
	# Example:
	# radiusd.conf: ippool students { [...] }
	# users file  : DEFAULT Group == students, Pool-Name := "students"

######################################################################
#
#  Version 2.0 has a useful new feature called "templates".
#
#  Use templates by uncommenting the line in radiusd.conf:
#
#	$INCLUDE templates.conf
#
#  The goal of the templates is to have common configuration located
#  in this file, and to list only the *differences* in the individual
#  sections.  This feature is most useful for sections like "clients"
#  or "home_servers", where many may be defined, and each one has
#  similar repeated configuration.
#
#  Something similar to templates can be done by putting common
#  configuration into separate files, and using "$INCLUDE file...",
#  but this is more flexible, and simpler to understand.  It's also
#  cheaper for the server, because "$INCLUDE" makes a copy of the
#  configuration for inclusion, and templates are simply referenced.
#
#  The templates are defined in the "templates" section, so that they
#  do not affect the rest of the server configuration.
#
#  A section can reference a template by using "$template name"
#
templates {
	#
	#  The contents of the templates section are other
	#  configuration sections that would normally go into
	#  the configuration files.
	#

	#
	#  This is a default template for the "home_server" section.
	#  Note that there is no name for the section.
	#
	#  Any configuration item that is valid for a "home_server"
	#  section is also valid here.  When a "home_server" section
	#  is defined in proxy.conf, this section is referenced as
	#  the template.
	#
	#  Configuration items that are explicitly listed in a
	#  "home_server" section of proxy.conf are used in
	#  preference to the configuration items listed here.
	#
	#  However, if a configuration item is NOT listed in a
	#  "home_server" section of proxy.conf, then the value here
	#  is used.
	#
	#  This functionality lets you put common configuration into
	#  a template, and to put only the unique configuration
	#  items in "proxy.conf".  Each section in proxy.conf can
	#  then contain a line "$template home_server", which will
	#  cause it to reference this template.
	#
	home_server {
		response_window = 20
		zombie_period = 40
		revive_interval = 120
		#
		#  Etc.
	}

	#
	#  You can also have named templates.  For example, if you
	#  are proxying to 3 different home servers all at the same
	#  site, with identical configurations (other than IP
	#  addresses), you can use this named template.
	#

	#  Then, each "home_server" section in "proxy.conf" would
	#  only list the IP address of that home server, and a
	#  line including the template:
	#
	#
	#	home_server foo {
	#		ipaddr = 192.0.2.10
	#		$template example_com
	#	}
	#
	#  That would tell FreeRADIUS to look in the "example.com"
	#  section here for the rest of the "home_server"
	#  configuration items.
	#
	#  For various reasons, you shouldn't have a "." in the template
	#  name.  Doing so means that the server will be unable to find
	#  the template.
	#
	example_com {
		type = auth
		port = 1812
		secret = testing123
		response_window = 20
		#
		# Etc...
	}

	#
	#  You can have templates for other sections, too, but they
	#  seem to be most useful for home_servers.
	#
	#  For now, you can use templates only for sections in
	#  radiusd.conf, not sub-sections.  So you still have to use
	#  the "$INCLUDE file.." method for things like defining
	#  multiple "sql" modules, each with similar configuration.
	#

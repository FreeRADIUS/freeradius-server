# Where to find documentation

All documentation for the server configuration files is now in the
`doc/raddb/` directory.

You can now also do:

	$ make asciidoc

from the top-level directory.  The configuration files here will be
converted to Asciidoc with markup, and placed in the `doc/raddb/`
directory.

#	This is the master dictionary file, which references the
#	pre-defined dictionary files included with the server.
#
#	Any new/changed attributes MUST be placed in this file, as

#
#  The DHCP dictionary is used only when the server is built with
#  "configure --with-dhcp".  It is not (and should not) be used in
#  other situations.  If you are running just a RADIUS server, this
#  line can be deleted.  If you are using DHCP, the following line
#  should be uncommented.
#
#  Ideally, the "configure" process should automatically enable this
#  dictionary, but we don't yet do that.
#
#$INCLUDE	@prefix@/share/freeradius/dictionary.dhcp

#
#	The filename given here should be an absolute path. 
#
$INCLUDE	@prefix@/share/freeradius/dictionary

#
#	All additional attributes an $INCLUDE's should go into
#	a file "dictionary.local".

#	If you want to add entries to the dictionary file,
#	which are NOT going to be placed in a RADIUS packet,
#	add them to the 'dictionary.local' file.
#
#	The numbers you pick should be between 3000 and 4000.
#	These attributes will NOT go into a RADIUS packet.
#
#	If you want that, you will need to use VSAs.  This means
#	requesting allocation of a Private Enterprise Code from
#	http://iana.org.  We STRONGLY suggest doing that only if
#	you are a vendor of RADIUS equipment.
#
#	See RFC 6158 for more details.

#
#	These attributes are examples.  Don't edit them here.
#	Instead, create a "dictionary.local" file, and place
#	them there.
#
#ATTRIBUTE	My-Local-String		3000	string
#ATTRIBUTE	My-Local-IPAddr		3001	ipaddr
#ATTRIBUTE	My-Local-Integer	3002	integer

#
#	Include dictionary.local, IF it exists.  Otherwise, ignore it.
#
#	This file WILL NOT EVER be created, edited, or modified
#	by FreeRADIUS.

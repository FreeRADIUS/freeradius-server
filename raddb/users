#
#	This file contains security and configuration information
#	for each user.  The first field is the user's name and
#	can be up to 8 characters in length.  This is followed (on
#	the same line) with the list of authentication requirements
#	for that user.  This can include password, comm server name,
#	comm server port number, protocol type (perhaps set by the "hints"
#	file), and huntgroup name (set by the "huntgroups" file).
#
#	When an authentication request is received from the comm server,
#	these values are tested. Only the first match is used unless the
#	"Fall-Through" variable is set to "Yes".
#
#	A special user named "DEFAULT" matches on all usernames.
#	You can have several DEFAULT entries. All entries are processed
#	in the order they appear in this file. The first entry that
#	matches the login-request will stop processing unless you use
#	the Fall-Through variable.
#
#	If you use the database support to turn this file into a .db or .dbm
#	file, the DEFAULT entries _have_ to be at the end of this file and
#	you can't have multiple entries for one username.
#
#	You don't need to specify a password if you set Auth-Type = System
#	on the list of authentication requirements. The RADIUS server
#	will then check the system password file.
#
#	Indented (with the tab character) lines following the first
#	line indicate the configuration values to be passed back to
#	the comm server to allow the initiation of a user session.
#	This can include things like the PPP configuration values
#	or the host to log the user onto.
#
#	You can include another `users' file with `$INCLUDE users.other'
#

# Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP)
#
#  This module definition allows you to use LDAP for
#  authorization and authentication.
#
#  See raddb/sites-available/default for reference to the
#  ldap module in the authorize and authenticate sections.
#
#  However, LDAP can be used for authentication ONLY when the
#  Access-Request packet contains a clear-text User-Password
#  attribute.  LDAP authentication will NOT work for any other
#  authentication method.
#
#  This means that LDAP servers don't understand EAP.  If you
#  force "Auth-Type = LDAP", and then send the server a
#  request containing EAP authentication, then authentication
#  WILL NOT WORK.
#
#  The solution is to use the default configuration, which does
#  work.
#
#  Setting "Auth-Type = LDAP" is ALMOST ALWAYS WRONG.  We
#  really can't emphasize this enough.

# Microsoft CHAP authentication
#
#  This module supports MS-CHAP and MS-CHAPv2 authentication.
#  It also enforces the SMB-Account-Ctrl attribute.
#
mschap {
	#
	#  If you are using /etc/smbpasswd, see the 'passwd'
	#  module for an example of how to use /etc/smbpasswd

	# if use_mppe is not set to no mschap will
	# add MS-CHAP-MPPE-Keys for MS-CHAPv1 and
	# MS-MPPE-Recv-Key/MS-MPPE-Send-Key for MS-CHAPv2
	#
#	use_mppe = no

	# if mppe is enabled require_encryption makes
	# encryption moderate
	#
#	require_encryption = yes

	# require_strong always requires 128 bit key
	# encryption
	#
#	require_strong = yes

	# Windows sends us a username in the form of
	# DOMAIN\user, but sends the challenge response
	# based on only the user portion.  This hack
	# corrects for that incorrect behavior.
	#
#	with_ntdomain_hack = no

	# The module can perform authentication itself, OR
	# use a Windows Domain Controller.  This configuration
	# directive tells the module to call the ntlm_auth
	# program, which will do the authentication, and return
	# the NT-Key.  Note that you MUST have "winbindd" and
	# "nmbd" running on the local machine for ntlm_auth
	# to work.  See the ntlm_auth program documentation
	# for details.
	#
	# If ntlm_auth is configured below, then the mschap
	# module will call ntlm_auth for every MS-CHAP
	# authentication request.  If there is a cleartext
	# or NT hashed password available, you can set
	# "MS-CHAP-Use-NTLM-Auth := No" in the control items,
	# and the mschap module will do the authentication itself,
	# without calling ntlm_auth.
	#
	# Be VERY careful when editing the following line!
	#
	# You can also try setting the user name as:
	#
	#	... --username=%{mschap:User-Name} ...
	#
	# In that case, the mschap module will look at the User-Name
	# attribute, and do prefix/suffix checks in order to obtain
	# the "best" user name for the request.
	#
#	ntlm_auth = "/path/to/ntlm_auth --request-nt-key --username=%{%{Stripped-User-Name}:-%{%{User-Name}:-None}} --challenge=%{%{mschap:Challenge}:-00} --nt-response=%{%{mschap:NT-Response}:-00}"

	# For Apple Server, when running on the same machine as
	# Open Directory.  It has no effect on other systems.
	#
#	use_open_directory = yes

#  Write "detail" files which can be read by radrelay.
#  This module should be used only by a server which receives
#  Accounting-Request packets from the network.
#
#  It should NOT be used in the radrelay.conf file.
#
#  Use it by adding "radrelay" to the "accounting" section:
#
#	accounting {
#		...
#		radrelay
#		...
#	}
#
detail radrelay {
	detailfile = ${radacctdir}/detail

	locking = yes

	#  The other directives from the main detail module
	#  can be used here, but they're not required.
}

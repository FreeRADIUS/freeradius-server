# This module loads RADIUS clients as needed, rather than when the server
# starts.
#
#  There are no configuration entries for this module.  Instead, it
#  relies on the "client" configuration.  You must:
#
#	1) link raddb/sites-enabled/dyanmic_clients to
#	   raddb/sites-available/dyanmic_clients
#
#	2) Define a client network/mask (see top of the above file)
#
#	3) uncomment the "directory" entry in that client definition
#
#	4) list "dynamic_clients" in the "authorize" section of the
#	   "dynamic_clients' virtual server.  The default example already
#	   does this.
#
#	5) put files into the above directory, one per IP.
#	   e.g. file "192.168.1.1" should contain a normal client definition
#	   for a client with IP address 192.168.1.1.
#
#  For more documentation, see the file:
#
#	raddb/sites-available/dynamic-clients 
#

#  # Local dictionary definitions
#
#  $Id$
#
#  This is the local dictionary file which can be
#  edited by local administrators.  It will be loaded
#  *after* the main dictionary files are loaded.
#
#  FreeRADIUS will automatically load the main dictionary files from:
#
#  	${prefix}/share/freeradius/dictionary
#
#  It is no longer necessary for this file to `$INCLUDE` the main
#  dictionaries from this file.  However, if the `$INCLUDE` line is
#  here, nothing bad will happen.

#
#  ## Editing the dictionary
#
#  Any new/changed attributes *must* be placed in this file.
#  The pre-defined dictionaries *should not* be edited.
#  See `man dictionary` for documentation on how dictionary
#  entries should be formatted.
#
#  All local attributes and `$INCLUDE` directives should
#  go into this file.
#
#  The numbers you pick should be between 3000 and 4000.
#  These attributes will *not* go into a RADIUS packet.
#
#  If you do want attributes to go into a RADIUS packet, you
#  will need to use VSAs. This means requesting allocation
#  of a Private Enterprise Code from http://iana.org/. We
#  strongly suggest doing that *only* if you are a vendor of
#  RADIUS equipment.
#
#  See `RFC 6158` for more details:
#    http://ietf.org/rfc/rfc6158.txt

#
#  ## Example attributes
#
#  The attributes below are examples. You should edit them as
#  required, or add your own.
#

#ATTRIBUTE	My-Local-String		3000	string
#ATTRIBUTE	My-Local-IPAddr		3001	ipaddr
#ATTRIBUTE	My-Local-Integer	3002	integer

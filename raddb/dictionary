#	This is the local dictionary file which can be
#	edited by local administrators.  It will be loaded
#	AFTER the main dictionary files are loaded.
#
#	As of version 3.0.2, FreeRADIUS will automatically
#	load the main dictionary files from
#
#		${prefix}/share/dictionary
#
#	It is no longer necessary for this file to $INCLUDE
#	the main dictionaries.  However, if the $INCLUDE
#	line is here, nothing bad will happen.
#
#	Any new/changed attributes MUST be placed in this file.
#	The pre-defined dictionaries SHOULD NOT be edited.
#
#	See "man dictionary" for documentation on its format.
#
#	$Id$
#

#
#	All local attributes and $INCLUDE's should go into
#	this file.
#

#	If you want to add entries to the dictionary file,
#	which are NOT going to be placed in a RADIUS packet,
#	add them to the 'dictionary.local' file.
#
#	The numbers you pick should be between 3000 and 4000.
#	These attributes will NOT go into a RADIUS packet.
#
#	If you want that, you will need to use VSAs.  This means
#	requesting allocation of a Private Enterprise Code from
#	http://iana.org.  We STRONGLY suggest doing that only if
#	you are a vendor of RADIUS equipment.
#
#	See RFC 6158 for more details.

#
#	These attributes are examples
#
#ATTRIBUTE	My-Local-String		3000	string
#ATTRIBUTE	My-Local-IPAddr		3001	ipaddr
#ATTRIBUTE	My-Local-Integer	3002	integer

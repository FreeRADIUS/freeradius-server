## vmpsd.conf	-- FreeRADIUS VMPS server configuration file.
##
##	http://www.freeradius.org/
##	$Id$
##

#
#	This configuration file is for a stand-alone VMPS server that
#	does not do RADIUS.  For an integrated radius + vmps server,
#	edit "radiusd.conf", and add two sections to it:
#
#		listen {
#			type = vmps
#			...
#		}
#
#		vmps {
#			...
#		}
#
#
#	See the text below for additional documentation on those two
#	sections.
#

#  	The location of other config files and
#  	logfiles are declared in this file
#
#  	Also general configuration for modules can be done
#  	in this file, it is exported through the API to
#  	modules that ask for it.
#
#	The configuration variables defined here are of the form ${foo}
#	They are local to this file, and do not change from request to
#	request.
#
#	The per-request variables are of the form %{Attribute-Name}, and
#	are taken from the values of the attribute in the incoming
#	request.  See 'doc/variables.txt' for more information.

#
#  Standard includes, etc.
#
#	FIXME: to make this work: prefix, etc.  See radiusd.conf...
#
prefix = @prefix@
exec_prefix = @exec_prefix@
sysconfdir = @sysconfdir@
localstatedir = @localstatedir@
sbindir = @sbindir@
logdir = @logdir@
raddbdir = @raddbdir@
radacctdir = @radacctdir@

#
#  The logging messages for the server are appended to the
#  tail of this file.
#
log_file = ${logdir}/vmpsd.log

#
#  Destination for log messages.  This can be one of:
#
#	files - log to ${log_file}, as defined above.
#	syslog - to syslog (see also the log{} section, below)
#	stdout - standard output
#	stderr - standard error.
#
#  The command-line option "-X" over-rides this option, and forces
#  logging to go to stdout.
#
log_destination = files

#
# libdir: Where to find the rlm_* modules.
#
#   This should be automatically set at configuration time.
#
#   If the server builds and installs, but fails at execution time
#   with an 'undefined symbol' error, then you can use the libdir
#   directive to work around the problem.
#
#   The cause is usually that a library has been installed on your
#   system in a place where the dynamic linker CANNOT find it.  When
#   executing as root (or another user), your personal environment MAY
#   be set up to allow the dynamic linker to find the library.  When
#   executing as a daemon, FreeRADIUS MAY NOT have the same
#   personalized configuration.
#
#   To work around the problem, find out which library contains that symbol,
#   and add the directory containing that library to the end of 'libdir',
#   with a colon separating the directory names.  NO spaces are allowed.
#
#   e.g. libdir = /usr/local/lib:/opt/package/lib
#
#   You can also try setting the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable
#   in a script which starts the server.
#
#   If that does not work, then you can re-configure and re-build the
#   server to NOT use shared libraries, via:
#
#	./configure --disable-shared
#	make
#	make install
#
libdir = @libdir@

#  pidfile: Where to place the PID of the RADIUS server.
#
#  The server may be signalled while it's running by using this
#  file.
#
#  This file is written when ONLY running in daemon mode.
#
#  e.g.:  kill -HUP `cat /var/run/radiusd/radiusd.pid`
#
pidfile = ${run_dir}/vmpsd.pid


# user/group: The name (or #number) of the user/group to run vmpsd as.
#
#   If these are commented out, the server will run as the user/group
#   that started it.  In order to change to a different user/group, you
#   MUST be root ( or have root privileges ) to start the server.
#
#   We STRONGLY recommend that you run the server with as few permissions
#   as possible.  That is, if you're not using shadow passwords, the
#   user and group items below should be set to 'nobody'.
#
#    On SCO (ODT 3) use "user = nouser" and "group = nogroup".
#
#  NOTE that some kernels refuse to setgid(group) when the value of
#  (unsigned)group is above 60000; don't use group nobody on these systems!
#
#  On systems with shadow passwords, you might have to set 'group = shadow'
#  for the server to be able to read the shadow password file.  If you can
#  authenticate users while in debug mode, but not in daemon mode, it may be
#  that the debugging mode server is running as a user that can read the
#  shadow info, and the user listed below can not.
#
#user = nobody
#group = nobody

#  max_request_time: The maximum time (in seconds) to handle a request.
#
#  Requests which take more time than this to process may be killed, and
#  a REJECT message is returned.
#
#  WARNING: If you notice that requests take a long time to be handled,
#  then this MAY INDICATE a bug in the server, in one of the modules
#  used to handle a request, OR in your local configuration.
#
#  This problem is most often seen when using an SQL database.  If it takes
#  more than a second or two to receive an answer from the SQL database,
#  then it probably means that you haven't indexed the database.  See your
#  SQL server documentation for more information.
#
#  Useful range of values: 5 to 120
#
max_request_time = 30

#  cleanup_delay: The time to wait (in seconds) before cleaning up
#  a reply which was sent to the NAS.
#
#  The VMPS request is normally cached internally for a short period
#  of time, after the reply is sent to the NAS.  The reply packet may be
#  lost in the network, and the NAS will not see it.  The NAS will then
#  re-send the request, and the server will respond quickly with the
#  cached reply.
#
#  If this value is set too low, then duplicate requests from the NAS
#  MAY NOT be detected, and will instead be handled as separate requests.
#
#  If this value is set too high, then the server will cache too many
#  requests, and some new requests may get blocked.  (See 'max_requests'.)
#
#  Useful range of values: 2 to 10
#
cleanup_delay = 5

#  listen: Make the server listen on a particular IP address, and send
#  replies out from that address. This directive is most useful for
#  hosts with multiple IP addresses on one interface.
#
#  If you want the server to listen on additional addresses, or on
#  additional ports, you can use multiple "listen" sections.
#
#  Each section make the server listen for only one type of packet,
#  therefore authentication and accounting have to be configured in
#  different sections.
#
#  The server ignore all "listen" section if you are using '-i' and '-p'
#  on the command line.
#
listen {
	#  IP address on which to listen.
	#  Allowed values are:
	#	dotted quad (1.2.3.4)
	#       hostname    (radius.example.com)
	#       wildcard    (*)
	ipaddr = *

	#  OR, you can use an IPv6 address, but not both
	#  at the same time.
#	ipv6addr = ::	# any.  ::1 == localhost

	#  Port on which to listen.
	#  Allowed values are:
	#	integer port number
	#	1589 is the default VMPS port.
	port = 1589

	#  Type of packets to listen for.  Use "vmps" for VMPSd.
	#
	type = vmps

	#  Some systems support binding to an interface, in addition
	#  to the IP address.  This feature isn't strictly necessary,
	#  but for sites with many IP addresses on one interface,
	#  it's useful to say "listen on all addresses for eth0".
	#
	#  If your system does not support this feature, you will
	#  get an error if you try to use it.
	#
#	interface = eth0

	#  Per-socket lists of clients.  This is a very useful feature.
	#
	#  The name here is a reference to a section elsewhere in
	#  radiusd.conf, or clients.conf.  Having the name as
	#  a reference allows multiple sockets to use the same
	#  set of clients.
	#
	#  If this configuration is used, then the global list of clients
	#  is IGNORED for this "listen" section.  Take care configuring
	#  this feature, to ensure you don't accidentally disable a
	#  client you need.
	#
	#  See clients.conf for the configuration of "per_socket_clients".
	#
#	clients = per_socket_clients
}

#  hostname_lookups: Log the names of clients or just their IP addresses
#  e.g., www.freeradius.org (on) or 206.47.27.232 (off).
#
#  The default is 'off' because it would be overall better for the net
#  if people had to knowingly turn this feature on, since enabling it
#  means that each client request will result in AT LEAST one lookup
#  request to the nameserver.   Enabling hostname_lookups will also
#  mean that your server may stop randomly for 30 seconds from time
#  to time, if the DNS requests take too long.
#
#  Turning hostname lookups off also means that the server won't block
#  for 30 seconds, if it sees an IP address which has no name associated
#  with it.
#
#  allowed values: {no, yes}
#
hostname_lookups = no

#  Core dumps are a bad thing.  This should only be set to 'yes'
#  if you're debugging a problem with the server.
#
#  allowed values: {no, yes}
#
allow_core_dumps = no

#
#  Logging section.  The various "log_*" configuration items
#  will eventually be moved here.
#
log {
	#
	#  Which syslog facility to use, if ${log_destination} == "syslog"
	#
	#  The exact values permitted here are OS-dependent.  You probably
	#  don't want to change this.
	#
	syslog_facility = daemon
}

# THREAD POOL CONFIGURATION
#
#  The thread pool is a long-lived group of threads which
#  take turns (round-robin) handling any incoming requests.
#
#  You probably want to have a few spare threads around,
#  so that high-load situations can be handled immediately.  If you
#  don't have any spare threads, then the request handling will
#  be delayed while a new thread is created, and added to the pool.
#
#  You probably don't want too many spare threads around,
#  otherwise they'll be sitting there taking up resources, and
#  not doing anything productive.
#
#  The numbers given below should be adequate for most situations.
#
thread pool {
	#  Number of servers to start initially --- should be a reasonable
	#  ballpark figure.
	start_servers = 5

	#  Limit on the total number of servers running.
	#
	#  If this limit is ever reached, clients will be LOCKED OUT, so it
	#  should NOT BE SET TOO LOW.  It is intended mainly as a brake to
	#  keep a runaway server from taking the system with it as it spirals
	#  down...
	#
	#  You may find that the server is regularly reaching the
	#  'max_servers' number of threads, and that increasing
	#  'max_servers' doesn't seem to make much difference.
	#
	#  If this is the case, then the problem is MOST LIKELY that
	#  your back-end databases are taking too long to respond, and
	#  are preventing the server from responding in a timely manner.
	#
	#  The solution is NOT do keep increasing the 'max_servers'
	#  value, but instead to fix the underlying cause of the
	#  problem: slow database, or 'hostname_lookups=yes'.
	#
	#  For more information, see 'max_request_time', above.
	#
	max_servers = 32

	#  Server-pool size regulation.  Rather than making you guess
	#  how many servers you need, The server dynamically adapts to
	#  the load it sees, that is, it tries to maintain enough
	#  servers to handle the current load, plus a few spare
	#  servers to handle transient load spikes.
	#
	#  It does this by periodically checking how many servers are
	#  waiting for a request.  If there are fewer than
	#  min_spare_servers, it creates a new spare.  If there are
	#  more than max_spare_servers, some of the spares die off.
	#  The default values are probably OK for most sites.
	#
	min_spare_servers = 3
	max_spare_servers = 10

	#  There may be memory leaks or resource allocation problems with
	#  the server.  If so, set this value to 300 or so, so that the
	#  resources will be cleaned up periodically.
	#
	#  This should only be necessary if there are serious bugs in the
	#  server which have not yet been fixed.
	#
	#  '0' is a special value meaning 'infinity', or 'the servers never
	#  exit'
	max_requests_per_server = 0

# MODULE CONFIGURATION
#
#  The names and configuration of each module is located in this section.
#
#  After the modules are defined here, they may be referred to by name,
#  in other sections of this configuration file.
#
modules {
	#
	#	Add modules here.  See "radiusd.conf" for examples.
	#
}

# Instantiation
#
#  This section orders the loading of the modules.  Modules
#  listed here will get loaded BEFORE the later sections like
#  authorize, authenticate, etc. get examined.
#
#  This section is not strictly needed.  When a section like
#  authorize refers to a module, it's automatically loaded and
#  initialized.  However, some modules may not be listed in any
#  of the following sections, so they can be listed here.
#
#  Also, listing modules here ensures that you have control over
#  the order in which they are initialized.  If one module needs
#  something defined by another module, you can list them in order
#  here, and ensure that the configuration will be OK.
#
instantiate {
	#
	#	Add modules here.  See "radiusd.conf" for examples.
	#
}

#
#  And the REAL contents.  This section is just like the "post-auth"
#  section of radiusd.conf.  In fact, it calls the "post-auth" component
#  of the modules that are listed here.  But it's called "vmps" for
#  simplicity.
#
vmps {
	#
	#  This is a hack for testing
	#
	update reply {
		VMPS-Packet-Type = VMPS-Join-Response
		VMPS-VLAN-Name = "foo"
		VMPS-Cookie = "%{VMPS-Mac}"
	}

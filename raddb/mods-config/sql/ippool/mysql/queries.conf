#
#  sqlippool (rlm_sqlippool) is called in the postauth section to allocate an IP address:
#
#    * If ${attribute_name} already set, do nothing (return noop)
#    * If no Pool-Name defined, do nothing (return noop)
#    * Run allocate_clear (if defined, runs at most once/second) to clean stale pool entries
#      * Don't define this if you want users to keep old addresses after outages
#    * Run allocate_find to get an ip address
#    * If not found, run pool_check (if defined)
#      * If pool exists, assume full and return notfound
#      * If pool does not exist, or pool_check not defined, return noop
#      * Unnecessary if not running redundant pool modules as otherwise
#        failure only has one meaning (pool is full)
#    * We have an address, run allocate_update
#
#  Everything else happens in the accounting section:
#    * Accounting start: run start_update
#    * Accounting alive (Interim-Update): run alive_update
#    * Accounting stop: run stop_update
#    * Accounting on: run on_clear (if defined)
#      * Typically sent on nas startup, don't use to clear table if you want
#        users to keep old addresses after outages
#    * Accounting off: run off_clear (if defined)
#      * Typically sent on nas shutdown, don't use to clear table if you want
#        users to keep old addresses after outages
#

#  Using SKIP LOCKED speed up the allocate_find query by 10
#  times. However, it requires MySQL >= 8.0.1, and InnoDB.

#
#  allocate_clear clears stale IP addresses before processing a new request
#
#  The first version clears based on pool_key and thus will only
#  clear previous entries for the user requesting an address.
#
#  The second version clears all stale allocations for the requesting NAS
#
#  Comment both out if you want users to generally keep old addresses
#  after outages

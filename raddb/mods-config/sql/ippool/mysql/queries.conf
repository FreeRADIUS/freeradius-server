#
#  sqlippool (rlm_sqlippool) is called in the postauth section to allocate an IP address:
#
#    * If ${attribute_name} already set, do nothing (return noop)
#    * If no Pool-Name defined, do nothing (return noop)
#    * Run allocate_find to get an ip address
#    * If not found, run pool_check (if defined)
#      * If pool exists, assume full and return notfound
#      * If pool does not exist, or pool_check not defined, return noop
#      * Unnecessary if not running redundant pool modules as otherwise
#        failure only has one meaning (pool is full)
#    * We have an address, run allocate_update
#
#  Everything else happens in the accounting section:
#    * Accounting start: run start_update
#    * Accounting alive (Interim-Update): run alive_update
#    * Accounting stop: run stop_update
#    * Accounting on: run on_clear (if defined)
#      * Typically sent on nas startup, don't use to clear table if you want
#        users to keep old addresses after outages
#    * Accounting off: run off_clear (if defined)
#      * Typically sent on nas shutdown, don't use to clear table if you want
#        users to keep old addresses after outages
#

#  Using SKIP LOCKED speed up the allocate_find query by 10
#  times. However, it requires MySQL >= 8.0.1, and InnoDB.
#
#  If SKIP LOCKED is used, all UPDATE queries like
#  on_clear and off_clear should update and lock
#  as few rows as possible. Rows are locked if they will be updated
#  or if they are traversed due to searching for rows that need to be updated.
#  Traversed and locked rows can be reduced by using proper indices, avoiding
#  full table scans and by specifying a precise update condition.
#  Many locked rows are a problem because an allocate_find query, which runs at the
#  same time, would skip these rows. The pool could wrongly appear as full
#  and the allocation of an IP would fail.
#
#  Uncomment the next line to automatically use SKIP LOCKED

#  pool_check allows the module to differentiate between a full pool
#  and no pool when an IP address could not be allocated so an appropriate

--  - Per-user data usage over time -
--  ---------------------------------
--
--  An extension to the standard schema to hold per-user data usage statistics
--  for arbitrary periods.
--
--  The data_usage_by_period table is populated by periodically calling the
--  fr_new_data_usage_period stored procedure.
--
--  This table can be queried in various ways to produce reports of aggregate
--  data use over time. For example, if the fr_new_data_usage_period SP is
--  invoked one per day just after midnight, to produce usage data with daily
--  granularity, then a reasonably accurate monthly bandwidth summary for a
--  given user could be obtained by queriing this table with:
--
--      SELECT
--          TO_CHAR(CURRENT_TIMESTAMP, 'YYYY-Month') AS month,
--          TRUNC(SUM(acctinputoctets)/1000/1000/1000,9) AS gb_in,
--          TRUNC(SUM(acctoutputoctets)/1000/1000/1000,9) AS gb_out
--      FROM
--          data_usage_by_period
--      WHERE
--          username='bob' AND
--          period_end IS NOT NULL
--      GROUP BY
--          month;
--
--           month      |    gb_in    |    gb_out

--
--  Stored procedure that when run with some arbitrary frequency, say
--  once per day by cron, will process the recent radacct entries to extract
--  time-windowed data containing acct{input,output}octets ("data usage") per
--  username, per period.
--
--  Each invocation will create new rows in the data_usage_by_period tables
--  containing the data used by each user since the procedure was last invoked.
--  The intervals do not need to be identical but care should be taken to
--  ensure that the start/end of each period aligns well with any intended
--  reporting intervals.

--  - "Lightweight" Accounting-On/Off strategy resources -
--  ------------------------------------------------------
--
--  The following resources are for use only when the "lightweight"
--  Accounting-On/Off strategy is enabled in queries.conf.
--
--  Instead of bulk closing the radacct sessions belonging to a reloaded NAS,
--  this strategy leaves them open and records the NAS reload time in the
--  nasreload table.
--
--  Where applicable, the onus is on the administator to:
--
--    * Consider the nas reload times when deriving a list of
--      active/inactive sessions, and when determining the duration of sessions
--      interrupted by a NAS reload. (Refer to the view below.)
--
--    * Close the affected sessions out of band. (Refer to the SP below.)
--
--
--  The radacct_with_reloads view presents the radacct table with two additional
--  columns: acctstoptime_with_reloads and acctsessiontime_with_reloads
--
--  Where the session isn't closed (acctstoptime IS NULL), yet it started before
--  the last reload of the NAS (radacct.acctstarttime < nasreload.reloadtime),
--  the derived columns are set based on the reload time of the NAS (effectively
--  the point in time that the session was interrupted.)
--
CREATE VIEW radacct_with_reloads AS
SELECT
    a.*,
    COALESCE(a.AcctStopTime,
        CASE WHEN a.AcctStartTime < n.ReloadTime THEN n.ReloadTime END
    ) AS AcctStopTime_With_Reloads,
    COALESCE(a.AcctSessionTime,
        CASE WHEN a.AcctStopTime IS NULL AND a.AcctStartTime < n.ReloadTime THEN
            EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (n.ReloadTime - a.AcctStartTime))
        END
    ) AS AcctSessionTime_With_Reloads
FROM radacct a
LEFT OUTER JOIN nasreload n USING (nasipaddress);


--
--  It may be desirable to periodically "close" radacct sessions belonging to a
--  reloaded NAS, replicating the "bulk close" Accounting-On/Off behaviour,
--  just not in real time.
--
--  The fr_radacct_close_after_reload SP will set radacct.acctstoptime to
--  nasreload.reloadtime, calculate the corresponding radacct.acctsessiontime,
--  and set acctterminatecause to "NAS reboot" for interrupted sessions. It
--  does so in batches, which avoids long-lived locks on the affected rows.
--
--  It can be invoked as follows:
--
--      CALL fr_radacct_close_after_reload();
--
--  Note: This SP requires PostgreSQL >= 11 which was the first version to
--  introduce PROCEDUREs which permit transaction control. This allows COMMIT
--  to be called to incrementally apply successive batch updates prior to the
--  end of the procedure. Prior to version 11 there exists only FUNCTIONs that
--  execute atomically. You can convert this procedure to a function, but by
--  doing so you are really no better off than performing a single,
--  long-running bulk update.
--
--  Note: This SP walks radacct in strides of v_batch_size. It will typically
--  skip closed and ongoing sessions at a rate significantly faster than
--  500,000 rows per second and process batched updates faster than 25,000
--  orphaned sessions per second. If this isn't fast enough then you should
--  really consider using a custom schema that includes partitioning by
--  nasipaddress or acct{start,stop}time.

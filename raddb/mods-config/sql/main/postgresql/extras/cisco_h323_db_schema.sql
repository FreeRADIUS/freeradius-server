 *
 * This is a custom SQL schema for doing H323 and SIP VoIP accounting
 * with FreeRadius and Cisco equipment. It is currently known to work
 * with 3640, 5300 and 5350 series as well as CSPS (Cisco SIP Proxy
 * Server).  It will scale A LOT better than the default radius schema
 * which is designed for simple dialup installations of FreeRadius.
 *
 * For this schema to work properly you MUST use
 * raddb/mods-config/sql/postgresql/voip-postpaid.conf rather than
 * raddb/mods-config/sql/postgresql/dialup.conf
 *
 * If you wish to do RADIUS Authentication using the same database,
 * you MUST use use raddb/mods-config/sql/postgresql/schema.sql as well as this schema.

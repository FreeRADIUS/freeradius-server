#
#  SQLite does not implement SELECT FOR UPDATE which is normally used to place
#  an exclusive lock over rows to prevent the same address from being
#  concurrently selected for allocation to multiple users.
#
#  The most granular read-blocking lock that SQLite has is an exclusive lock
#  over the database, so that's what we use. All locking in SQLite is performed
#  over the entire database and we perform a row update for any IP that we
#  allocate, requiring an exclusive lock. Taking the exclusive lock from the
#  start of the transaction (even if it were not required to guard the SELECT)
#  is actually quicker than if we deferred it causing SQLite to "upgrade" the
#  automatic shared lock for the transaction to an exclusive lock for the
#  subsequent UPDATE.

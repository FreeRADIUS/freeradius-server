#	Configuration for Mongo.
#
#	Note that the Mongo driver is experimental.  The FreeRADIUS developers
#	are unable to help with the syntax of the Mongo queries.  Please see
#	the Mongo documentation for that syntax.
#
#	The Mongo driver supports only the following methods:
#
#		aggregate
#		findAndModify
#		findOne
#		insert
#
#	For examples, see the query files:
#
#		raddb/mods-config/sql/main/mongo/queries.conf
#		raddb/mods-config/sql/main/mongo/schema-sample.js
#
#	In order to use findAndModify with an aggretation pipleline, make
#	sure that you are running MongoDB version 5.0 or greater. FreeRADIUS
#	assumes that the paramaters passed to the methods are supported by the
#	version of MongoDB which it is connected to.

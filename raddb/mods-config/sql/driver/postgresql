	#  states {}:: Behaviour override for various sqlstates.
	#
	#  ISO/IEC 9075:2011 defines standard error codes or 'sqlstates' which relate to
	#  common error conditions in SQL databases.
	#
	#  FreeRADIUS maps sqlstates to internal rcodes which determine what action the
	#  SQL module should perform next.
	#
	#  Matching states returned from the database to states within FreeRADIUS is done
	#  using a prefix trie, with the longest (most specific) match being used.
	#
	#  Each sqlstate consists of five alphanumeric characters in the format `CCSSS`,
	#  where `C` is a class identifier, and `S` is a subclass identifier.
	#
	#  [options="header,autowidth"]
	#  |===
	#  | rcode       | Action
	#  | `ok`        | Behave as though the previous query executed successfully.
	#  | `alternate` | Execute an alternate query if available.
	#  | `error`     | Cause the SQL module to return 'fail'.  Used for error conditions.
	#  | `invalid`   | Cause the SQL module to return 'invalid'.  Used for invalid queries.
	#  | `reconnect` | Forcefully close the current connection and establish a new one.
	#  | `empty`     | Behave as though the previous query returned no result.
	#  |===
	#
	#  Each entry in the `states {}` section below should be in the form
	#  `<sqlstate> = <rcode>`, where `<sqlstate>` is between two and five alphanumeric
	#  characters.
	#
	#  With very few exceptions the default rules only specify rcodes for _classes_
	#  of sqlstates.  This means if you want to change the behaviour for whole classes of
	#  sqlstates you can just specify the class identifier instead of specifying sqlstates.
	#
	#  If for example you wanted all warnings to be treated as errors you could add
	#  `01 = error` to the states section below.
	#
	#  NOTE: In the vast majority of situations you will not need to override the default
	#  sqlstate actions.  This is provided to allow you to 'hotpatch' your configuration
	#  to work around issues with your DB, or in the case where you've discovered the
	#  default rcode for an sqlstate is incorrect (in which case please inform the
	#  development team and we'll correct it).
	#
	states {
		# Re-establish the connection after each successful query.
		# Useful for annoying your DBA.
#		00000 = reconnect

		# Treat all warnings as errors
#		01 = error
	}

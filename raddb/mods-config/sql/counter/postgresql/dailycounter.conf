#  This query properly handles calls that span from the
#  previous reset period into the current period but
#  involves more work for the SQL server than those
#  below

query = "\

#  This query ignores calls that started in a previous
#  reset period and continue into into this one. But it
#  is a little easier on the SQL server

#query = "\
#	SELECT SUM(AcctSessionTime) \

#  This query is the same as above, but demonstrates an
#  additional counter parameter '%%e' which is the
#  timestamp for the end of the period

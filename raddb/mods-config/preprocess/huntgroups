# huntgroups	This file defines the `huntgroups' that you have. A
#		huntgroup is defined by specifying the IP address of
#		the NAS and possibly a port.
#
#		Matching is done while RADIUS scans the user file; if it
#		includes the selection criteria "Huntgroup-Name == XXX"
#		the huntgroup is looked up in this file to see if it
#		matches. There can be multiple definitions of the same
#		huntgroup; the first one that matches will be used.
#
#		This file can also be used to define restricted access
#		to certain huntgroups. The second and following lines
#		define the access restrictions (based on username and
#		UNIX usergroup) for the huntgroup.
#

#
# Our POP in Alphen a/d Rijn has 3 terminal servers. Create a Huntgroup-Name
# called Alphen that matches on all three terminal servers.
#
#alphen		NAS-IP-Address == 192.0.2.5
#alphen		NAS-IP-Address == 192.0.2.6
#alphen		NAS-IP-Address == 192.0.2.7

#
# The POP in Delft consists of only one terminal server.
#
#delft		NAS-IP-Address == 198.51.100.5

#
# Port 0 on the first terminal server in Alphen are connected to
# a huntgroup that is for business users only. Note that only one
# of the username or groupname has to match to get access (OR/OR).
#
# Note that this huntgroup is a subset of the "alphen" huntgroup.

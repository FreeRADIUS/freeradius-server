#
# 	Configuration file for the rlm_files module.
# 	Please see rlm_files documentation for more information.
#
# 	This file contains authentication security and configuration
#	information for each user.  Accounting requests are NOT processed
#	through this file.  Instead, see the 'accounting' file in this directory.
#
#	The first field is the user's name, followed (on the same
#	line) with the list of check items for that user.  The next
#	lines are reply items, which must begin with tabs.
#
#	If you are not sure why a particular reply is being sent by the
#	server, then run the server in debugging mode (radiusd -X), and
#	you will see which entries in this file are matched.
#
#	The special attribute Fall-Through is used to control whether or not
#	multiple entries match.
#
#	A special entry "DEFAULT" matches all entries.  You can have
#	several DEFAULT entries. All entries are processed in the
#	order they appear in this file. The first entry that matches
#	the login-request will stop processing unless you use the
#	Fall-Through variable.
#
#	You can include another `users' file with `$INCLUDE users.other'

#
#	Entries below this point are examples included in the server for
#	educational purposes. They may be deleted from the deployed
#	configuration without impacting the operation of the server.
#

#
# Deny access for a specific user.  Note that this entry MUST
# be before any other 'Auth-Type' attribute which results in the user
# being authenticated.
#
# Note that there is NO 'Fall-Through' attribute, so the user will not
# be given any additional resources.

# Note that there is NO 'Fall-Through' attribute, so the user will not
# be given any additional resources.

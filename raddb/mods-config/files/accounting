#	This is like the 'users' file, but it is processed only for
#	accounting packets.
#

#  Select between different accounting methods based for example on the
#  Realm, the Huntgroup-Name or any combinaison of the attribute/value
#  pairs contained in an accounting packet.
#
#  You will need to add an "Acct-Type foo {...}" subsection to the
#  main "accounting" section in order for these sample configurations
#  to work.

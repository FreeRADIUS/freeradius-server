#  SNMP configuration
#
#  NOTE: This part is only working if your radiusd is compiled with SNMP
#  support.
#
#  smux_password: Password used for SMUX registration.
#
#  Specifies password used when connecting to the SNMP master agent.
#  This must match the password as configured on the agent. The OID
#  used to register the radius subagent is 1.3.6.1.4.1.11344.1.1.1.
#  A sample entry for the ucd-snmp deamon looks like this:
#
#  smuxpeer .1.3.6.1.4.1.11344.1.1.1 verysecret
#
#  A sample entry for AIX 4.3 is:
#
#  smux 1.3.6.1.4.1.11344.1.1.1 verysecret
#
#  The default password is an empty password.
#
#smux_password = verysecret

#
#  snmp_write_access:
#
#  Controls if write access to the radiusd via SNMP is enabled or not.
#  Set this value to yes, if you want to be able to reload radiusd from
#  your network management station.
#
#  For this to work, you also have to make sure that your master agent
#  is configured to allow SNMP set requests. For security reasons, this
#  setting defaults to no.
#
# allowed values: {no, yes}
#
#snmp_write_access = yes

#	Please read the documentation file ../doc/rlm_attr_filter
#	for more information.
#
#	This file contains security and configuration information
#	for each realm.  The first field is the realm name and
#	can be up to 253 characters in length.  This is followed (on
#	the next line) with the list of filter rules to be used to
#       decide what attributes we allow proxy servers to return to us
#       for this realm.
#
#	When a proxy-reply request is received from a proxy server,
#	these values are tested. Only the first match is used unless the
#	"Fall-Through" variable is set to "Yes".  In that case the rules
#       defined in the DEFAULT case are processed as well.
#
#	A special user named "DEFAULT" matches on all realm names.
#	You can have only one DEFAULT entry. All entries are processed
#	in the order they appear in this file. The first entry that
#	matches the login-request will stop processing unless you use
#	the Fall-Through variable.
#
#	Indented (with the tab character) lines following the first
#	line indicate the filter rules to be used by the server to
#
#	You can include another `attrs' file with `$INCLUDE attrs.other'

# This is a complete entry for "fisp". Note that there is no Fall-Through
# entry so that no DEFAULT entry will be used, and the server will NOT
# allow any other a/v pairs other than the ones listed here.
#
# These rules allow:
#     o  Only Framed-User Service-Types ( no telnet, rlogin, tcp-clear )
#     o  PPP sessions ( no SLIP, CSLIP, etc. )
#     o  dynamic ip assignment ( can't assign a static ip )
#     o  an idle timeout value set to 600 seconds (10 min) or less
#     o  a max session time set to 28800 seconds (8 hours) or less

# that the DEFAULT filter rules are used in addition to these.
#
# These rules allow:

# The rest of this file contains the DEFAULT entry.
# DEFAULT matches with all realm names.

#
# realms	This file contains a list of realms. When a user logs
#		in with @realm as the last part of the loginname,
#		the realm part is looked up in this file. If found,
#		the request is sent to the listed remote radius server.
#
#		Description of the fields:
#
#		* The first field is a realm name.
#		  The realm DEFAULT matches all realms.
#		* The second field is a hostname. Optional is :port to
#		  use a non-standard port. In that case, port is the
#		  authentication port and the accounting port is taken
#		  as port + 1.
#		  If this field is set to LOCAL, the request is processed
#		  normally without sending it to a remote radius server.
#		* Extra fields with options can follow. Currently
#		  defined options:
#		  - nostrip	do not strip @realm from the username
#		  - notsuffix	do not match as username@suffix
#

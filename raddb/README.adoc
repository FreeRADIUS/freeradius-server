= Documentation for v4

All of the documentation, READMEs, etc. for this directory are now
stored in Antora, in the `doc/antora/modules/reference/pages/raddb/`
directory.  The files in this directory are automatically converted to
Asciidoc during the build process, and added to the cross-linked
documentation.

If the server is being built from source, you can build the HTML
documentation and see if via the following commands:

```
make docsite
ls build/docsite/freeradius-server/4.0.0/index.html
```

If the server is pre-packaged, then the documentation should be
available as a separate package.

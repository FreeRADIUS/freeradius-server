#
#  = Client Definitions
#
#  The `clients.conf` file defines global clients.  These clients are
#  systems which are permitted to send packets to the server.  For
#  security, packets from other IP addresses are ignored.
#

#
#  ## Client subsection
#
#  A client is defined via a section called `client NAME { ... }`.
#  The NAME field is mandatory, and is used as the "short name" of the
#  client.
#
#  The default configuration allows packets from 127.0.0.1, and no
#  other IP address.  This configuration is to allow testing of the
#  server after an initial installation.  If you are not going to be
#  permitting RADIUS queries from localhost, we suggest that you
#  delete, or comment out, the 'localhost' entry.
#
client localhost {
	#
	#  ipaddr:: define the unique IP address (or network) for this client.
	#
	#  NOTE: Only *one* of ipaddr, ipv4addr, ipv6addr may be
	#  specified for a client.
	#
	#  IPv4 or IPv6 addresses with optional CIDR notation `/<mask>` to
	#  specify ranges can be used. `ipaddr` will also accept domain
	#  names, e.g. `example.org`, and will resolve the name via DNS
	#  (however, see note of recommendation below).
	#
	#  If both A and AAAA records are found, A records will be
	#  used in preference to AAAA.
	#
	ipaddr = 127.0.0.1

	#
	#  ipv4addr:: Similar to `ipaddr`, but only allows v4
	#  addresses. Looks up A record for domain names.
	#
	#  * `*` is "any" address.
	#  * `127.0.0.1` is localhost.
	#
#	ipv4addr = *

	#
	#  ipv6addr:: Similar to `ipaddr` but only allows v6
	#  addresses. Looks up AAAA record for domain names.
	#
	#  * `::` is "any" address.
	#  * `::1` is localhost.
	#
#	ipv6addr = ::

	#
	#  NOTE: We *strongly* recommend using IP addresses instead of
	#  host names.  Using host names means that the server will do
	#  DNS lookups when it starts, making it dependent on DNS.
	#  i.e. If anything goes wrong with DNS, the server won't
	#  start!
	#
	#  The server also looks up the IP address from DNS once, and
	#  only once, when it starts.  If the DNS record is later
	#  updated, the server *will not* see that update.
	#

	#
	#  proto:: The transport protocol used by this client.
	#
	#  If unspecified, defaults to "udp", which is the traditional
	#  RADIUS transport.  It may also be "tcp", in which case the
	#  server will accept connections from this client *only* over TCP.
	#
	proto = *

	#
	#  secret:: The shared secret use to "encrypt" and "sign"
	#  packets between the NAS and FreeRADIUS.  You *must*
	#  change this secret from the default, otherwise it's not
	#  a secret any more!
	#
	#  The secret can be any string, up to 8k characters in length.
	#
	#  Control codes can be entered via octal encoding,
	#	e.g. `\101\102` is the same as `AB`
	#  Quotation marks can be entered by escaping them,
	#	e.g. `foo\"bar`
	#
	#  An important note on security:  The security of the
	#  RADIUS protocol depends *completely* on this secret! We
	#  recommend using a shared secret that is composed of:
	#
	#  * upper case letters
	#  * lower case letters
	#  * numbers
	#
	#  And is *at least* 8 characters, but preferably 16 characters in
	#  length.  The secret *must* be random, and should not be words,
	#  phrase, or anything else that is recognisable.
	#
	#  The default secret below is only for testing, and should
	#  not be used in any real environment.
	#
	secret = testing123

	#
	#  require_message_authenticator:: Old-style clients do not send a
	#  `Message-Authenticator` in an `Access-Request`. RFC 5080 suggests
	#  that all clients *should* include it in an Access-Request. The
	#  configuration item below allows the server to require it. If a
	#  client is required to include a `Message-Authenticator` and it
	#  does not, then the packet will be silently discarded.
	#
	#  Allowed values: yes, no
	#
	require_message_authenticator = no

	#
	#  shortname:: The short name is used as an alias for the fully
	#  qualified domain name, or the IP address.
	#
	#  It is accepted for compatibility with 1.x, but it is no
	#  longer necessary in >= 2.0.
	#
	#  By default, `shortname` is set to the name of the subsection.
	#  e.g. if we have `client localhost {...}`, then `shortname`
	#  is set to `localhost`.
	#
#	shortname = localhost

	#
	#  virtual_server:: Set the virtual server
	#
#	virtual_server = default

	#
	#  response_window:: How long the client has to respond.
	#
#	response_window = 0

	#
	#  track_connections:: Allow connected sockets to be set on a per-client basis.
	#
#	track_connections = no

	#
	#  ### Connection limiting
	#
	#  Connection limiting is only for clients which use `proto = tcp`.
	#
	#  The `limit` section is ignored for clients which use UDP
	#  transport.
	#
	limit {
		#
		#  max_connections:: Limit the number of simultaneous TCP
		#  connections from a client.
		#
		#  The default is 16.
		#  Setting this to 0 means "no limit".
		#
		max_connections = 16

		#  The per-socket "max_requests" option does not exist.

		#
		#  lifetime:: The lifetime, in seconds, of a TCP  connection.
		#  After this lifetime, the connection will be closed.
		#
		#  Setting this to 0 means "forever".
		#
		lifetime = 0

		#
		#  idle_timeout:: The idle timeout, in seconds, of a TCP
		#  connection. If no packets have been received over the
		#  connection for this time, the connection will be closed.
		#
		#  Setting this to 0 means "no timeout".
		#
		#  We *strongly recommend* that you set an idle timeout.
		#
		idle_timeout = 30
	}
}

#
#  ## Client examples
#

#
#  Defining an IPv6 client for `localhost` using the `ipv6addr` option.
#
client localhost_ipv6 {
	ipv6addr	= ::1
	secret		= testing123
}

#
#  All IPv6 Site-local clients
#
#client sitelocal_ipv6 {
#	ipv6addr	= fe80::/16
#	secret		= testing123
#}

#
#  Client that uses a DNS hostname.
#  (See important note on the use of hostname above.)
#
#client example.org {
#	ipaddr		= radius.example.org
#	secret		= testing123
#}

#
#  You can specify one secret for a network of clients.
#  When a client request comes in, the *best* match is chosen,
#  i.e. the entry from the smallest possible network.
#
#client private-network-1 {
#	ipaddr		= 192.0.2.0/24
#	secret		= testing123-1
#}

#client private-network-2 {
#	ipaddr		= 198.51.100.0/24
#	secret		= testing123-2
#}

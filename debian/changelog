freeradius (2.1.7+dfsg-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Adopting the package, closes: #536623.
  * New upstream version, closes: #513484.
    + Fixes the blooper in unlang evaluation logic, closes: #526175.
  * Used quilt (and added README.source), and moved upstream file patching
    into debian/patches/. The source is no longer in collab-maint git
    (to make it simpler for me to finally get this out the door), but
    kept the .gitignore should we need that again.
  * Dropped the dialup_admin/bin/backup_radacct patch (integrated upstream).
  * Dropped the raddb/Makefile patch (problem no longer exists upstream).
  * Dropped the lib/packet.c lib/radius.c main/listen.c patches (was from
    upstream 2.0.5 anyway).
  * Dropped references to otp.conf, it no longer exists upstream.
    Keep removing the conffile statoverride in prerm.
  * Dropped references to snmp.conf, it no longer exists upstream.
    Keep removing the conffile statoverride in prerm.
  * Ship /etc/freeradius/modules/* in the freeradius package.
  * Stop shipping sites-enabled symlinks in the package and instead create
    them only on initial install, thanks to Matej Vela, closes: #533396.
  * Add export PATH="${PATH:+$PATH:}/usr/sbin:/sbin" to the init script
    at the request of John Morrissey, closes: #550143.
  * Stop installing /var/run/freeradius in the package to silence Lintian.
    The init script already recreates it at will.
  * Remove executable bit from example.pl to silence Lintian.

    - should not need to manually remove the init script on purge (it's a dpkg
      managed conffile)
    - Only do user management stuff if user is missing.  No point rerunning it
      every upgrade.
    - Install /etc/freeradius/dictionary with relaxed permissions, but never
      touch it again (closes: #334299)

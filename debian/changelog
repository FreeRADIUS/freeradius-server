  * Full support for CoA and Disconnect packets as per RFC 3576 and RFC 5176.  Both receiving and proxying CoA is supported.
  * Added "src_ipaddr" configuration to "home_server".  See proxy.conf for details.
  * radsniff now accepts -I, to read from a filename instead of a device.

  * Added example of attr_filter for Access-Challenge packets
  * Added support for udpfromto in DHCP code

  * Document "chase_referrals" and "rebind" in raddb/modules/ldap
  * Preliminary implementation of DHCP relay.
  * Made thread pool section optional.  If it doesn't exist, the server will run single-threaded.

  * Extended size of "attribute" field in SQL to 64.
  * Fixes to ruby module to be more careful about when it builds.

  * Make rlm_perl keep tags for tagged attributes in more situations

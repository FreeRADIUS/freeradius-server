freeradius (2.1.8+dfsg-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream version.
    + Fixes several showstopper bugs, hence increased urgency.
    + Includes OpenSSL+GPL license exception, closes: #499120.
    + Fixes typo in a warning, closes: #523074.
  * Added libssl-dev into build-depends and enabled the building of
    modules that just depend on OpenSSL, namely rlm_eap_peap, rlm_eap_tls,
    rlm_eap_ttls, and rlm_otp, closes: #266229.
  * Because the configuration of EAP+SSL modules now actually kicks in, its
    non-existent certificate file would break the server start by default.
    Depend on ssl-cert, make use of make-ssl-cert and openssl, and add
    freerad to the ssl-cert group in the postinst to get us past the
    problematic default settings so that we don't crash and burn on clean
    upgrades, but otherwise leave everything else to the admin.
  * Ship /etc/freeradius/attrs.access_challenge, like the others.
  * Moved otp.conf and snmp.conf statoverride handling to the preinst
    and used rm_conffile on them as well.
  * Updated upstream changelog handling a bit.

freeradius (2.1.7+dfsg-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Adopting the package, closes: #536623.
  * New upstream version, closes: #513484.
    + Fixes the blooper in unlang evaluation logic, closes: #526175.
  * Used quilt (and added README.source), and moved upstream file patching
    into debian/patches/. The source is no longer in collab-maint git
    (to make it simpler for me to finally get this out the door), but
    kept the .gitignore should we need that again.
  * Dropped the dialup_admin/bin/backup_radacct patch (integrated upstream).
  * Dropped the raddb/Makefile patch (problem no longer exists upstream).
  * Dropped the lib/packet.c lib/radius.c main/listen.c patches (was from
    upstream 2.0.5 anyway).
  * Dropped references to otp.conf, it no longer exists upstream.
    Keep removing the conffile statoverride in prerm.
  * Dropped references to snmp.conf, it no longer exists upstream.
    Keep removing the conffile statoverride in prerm.
  * Ship /etc/freeradius/modules/* in the freeradius package.
  * Stop shipping sites-enabled symlinks in the package and instead create
    them only on initial install, thanks to Matej Vela, closes: #533396.
  * Add export PATH="${PATH:+$PATH:}/usr/sbin:/sbin" to the init script
    at the request of John Morrissey, closes: #550143.
  * Stop installing /var/run/freeradius in the package to silence Lintian.
    The init script already recreates it at will.
  * Remove executable bit from example.pl to silence Lintian.

  [ Stephen Gran ]
  * Acknowledge my previous NMU's (closes: #351732, #359042)

    - now use reload on upgrade of modules

      daemon isn't running (closes: #374670, #351735)
    - stop using command -v in /bin/sh scripts
  * General maintainer script overhaul:
    - Don't rm -rf something in /etc (ouch)
    - Use chown -R instead of 'find .. -exec'
    - should not need to manually remove the init script on purge (it's a dpkg
      managed conffile)
    - Only do user management stuff if user is missing.  No point rerunning it
      every upgrade.
    - Install /etc/freeradius/dictionary with relaxed permissions, but never
      touch it again (closes: #334299)
    - switch to debhelper files where possible.  I like an easy to read

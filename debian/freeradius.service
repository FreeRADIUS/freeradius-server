# FreeRADIUS can do static evaluation of policy language rules based
# on environmental variables which is very useful for doing per-host
# customization.
# Unfortunately systemd does not allow variable substitutions such
# as %H or $(hostname) in the EnvironmentFile.
# We provide HOSTNAME here for convenience.
Environment=HOSTNAME=%H

# Not needed/used unless the freeradius-snmp package is installed.
# Used by snmptrap and friends to determine where to stored persistent
# configuration files.

# Limit memory to 2G this is fine for %99.99 of deployments.  FreeRADIUS
# is not memory hungry, if it's using more than this, then there's probably
# a leak somewhere.

# Ensure the daemon can still write its pidfile after it drops
# privileges. Combination of options that work on a variety of

TODO list for the Debian package:

26 Nov 2000 -- Chad Miller
* Begin writing manpages for topics listed in the
  debian/freeradius.undocumented file.

09 July 2003 -- Paul Hampson
* Debian Policy compliance audit (Not hard, only 3.5.9 => 3.5.10)
* Debhelper usage check/best practice audit
  (http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2003/debian-devel-announce-200303/msg00002.html)
* Check licensing on RFCs.... Will have to remove from src package if they're
  bad. (Not that hard, thankfully.)
* See if it builds cleanly on Debian/stable: libsasl2-dev has to become libsasl-dev, at least.
* Investigate use of logrotate.
